However, the geographic extent of Denisovan ancestry has not been determined, and moreover the relationship between the Denisovan ancestry in Oceania and that elsewhere has not been studied. Here we analyze genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from 2,493 individuals from 221 worldwide populations, and show that there is a widespread signal of a very low level of Denisovan ancestry across Eastern Eurasian and Native American (EE/NA) populations. We also verify a higher level of Denisovan ancestry in Oceania than that in EE/NA; the Denisovan ancestry in Oceania is correlated with the amount of New Guinea ancestry, but not the amount of Australian ancestry, indicating that recent gene ﬂow from New Guinea likely accounts for signals of Denisovan ancestry across Oceania. However, Denisovan ancestry in EE/NA populations is equally correlated with their New Guinea or their Australian ancestry, suggesting a common source for the Denisovan ancestry in EE/NA and Oceanian populations. Our results suggest that Denisovan ancestry in EE/NA is derived either from common ancestry with, or gene ﬂow from, the common ancestor of New Guineans and Australians, indicating a more complex history involving East Eurasians and Oceanians than previously suspected.},

Genome-wide data are particularly useful for inferring migrations, admixture, and fine structure, as well as for estimating population divergence and admixture times and fluctuations in effective population sizes. In this review, we highlight some of the stories that have emerged from the analyses of genome-wide SNP genotyping data concerning the human history of Southern Africa, India, Oceania, Island South East Asia, Europe and the Americas and comment on possible future study directions. We also discuss advantages and drawbacks of using SNP-arrays, with a particular focus on the ascertainment bias, and ways to circumvent it.},

	abstract = {A widely accepted two-wave scenario of human settlement of Oceania involves the ﬁrst out-of-Africa migration circa 50,000 years ago (ya), and the more recent Austronesian expansion, which reached the Bismarck Archipelago by 3,450 ya. Whereas earlier genetic studies provided evidence for extensive sex-biased admixture between the incoming and the indigenous populations, some archaeological, linguistic, and genetic evidence indicates a more complicated picture of settlement. To study regional variation in Oceania in more detail, we have compiled a genome-wide data set of 823 individuals from 72 populations (including 50 populations from Oceania) and over 620,000 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We show that the initial dispersal of people from the Bismarck Archipelago into Remote Oceania occurred in a “leapfrog” fashion, completely by-passing the main chain of the Solomon Islands, and that the colonization of the Solomon Islands proceeded in a bidirectional manner. Our results also support a divergence between western and eastern Solomons, in agreement with the sharp linguistic divide known as the Tryon–Hackman line. We also report substantial post-Austronesian gene ﬂow across the Solomons. In particular, Santa Cruz (in Remote Oceania) exhibits extraordinarily high levels of Papuan ancestry that cannot be explained by a simple bottleneck/founder event scenario. Finally, we use simulations to show that discrepancies between different methods for dating admixture likely reﬂect different sensitivities of the methods to multiple admixture events from the same (or similar) sources. Overall, this study points to the importance of ﬁne-scale sampling to understand the complexities of human population history.},

	abstract = {The question of the origins of the Polynesians has, for over 200 years, been the subject of adventure science. Since Captain Cook's first speculations on these isolated Pacific islanders, their language affiliations have been seen as an essential clue to the solution. The geographic and numeric centre of gravity of the Austronesian language family is in island Southeast Asia, which was therefore originally seen as their dispersal homeland. However, another view has held sway for 15 years, the ‘out of Taiwan’ model, popularly known as the ‘express train to Polynesia’. This model, based on the combined evidence of archaeology and linguistics, proposes a common origin for all Austronesian-speaking populations, in an expansion of rice agriculturalists from south China/Taiwan beginning around 6,000 years ago. However, it is becoming clear that there is, in fact, little supporting evidence in favour of this view. Alternative models suggest that the ancestors of the Polynesians achieved their maritime skills and horticultural Neolithic somewhere between island Southeast Asia and Melanesia, at an earlier date. Recent advances in human genetics now allow for an independent test of these models, lending support to the latter view rather than the former. Although local gene flow occurring between the bio-geographic regions may have been the means for the dramatic cultural spread out to the Pacific, the immediate genetic substrate for the Polynesian expansion came not from Taiwan, but from east of the Wallace line, probably in Wallacea itself.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have detailed a remarkable degree of genetic and linguistic diversity in Northern Island Melanesia. Here we utilize that diversity to examine two models of genetic and linguistic coevolution. The first model predicts that genetic and linguistic correspondences formed following population splits and isolation at the time of early range expansions into the region. The second is analogous to the genetic model of isolation by distance, and it predicts that genetic and linguistic correspondences formed through continuing genetic and linguistic exchange between neighboring populations. We tested the predictions of the two models by comparing observed and simulated patterns of genetic variation, genetic and linguistic trees, and matrices of genetic, linguistic, and geographic distances. The data consist of 751 autosomal microsatellites and 108 structural linguistic features collected from 33 Northern Island Melanesian populations. The results of the tests indicate that linguistic and genetic exchange have erased any evidence of a splitting and isolation process that might have occurred early in the settlement history of the region. The correlation patterns are also inconsistent with the predictions of the isolation by distance coevolutionary process in the larger Northern Island Melanesian region, but there is strong evidence for the process in the rugged interior of the largest island in the region (New Britain). There we found some of the strongest recorded correlations between genetic, linguistic, and geographic distances. We also found that, throughout the region, linguistic features have generally been less likely to diffuse across population boundaries than genes. The results from our study, based on exceptionally fine-grained data, show that local genetic and linguistic exchange are likely to obscure evidence of the early history of a region, and that language barriers do not particularly hinder genetic exchange. In contrast, global patterns may emphasize more ancient demographic events, including population splits associated with the early colonization of major world regions.},

Here, we substantially expand on existing studies by reporting genome-scale data for nearly 500 individuals from 25 populations in Island Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Oceania, notably including previously unsampled islands across the Indonesian archipelago. We use high-resolution analyses of haplotype diversity to reveal ﬁne detail of regional admixture patterns, with a particular focus on the Holocene. We ﬁnd that recent population history within Indonesia is complex, and that populations from the Philippines made important genetic contributions in the early phases of the Austronesian expansion. Different, but interrelated processes, acted in the east and west. The Austronesian migration took several centuries to spread across the eastern part of the archipelago, where genetic admixture postdates the archeological signal. As with the Neolithic expansion further east in Oceania and in Europe, genetic mixing with local inhabitants in eastern Indonesia lagged behind the arrival of farming populations. In contrast, western Indonesia has a more complicated admixture history shaped by interactions with mainland Asian and Austronesian newcomers, which for some populations occurred more than once. Another layer of complexity in the west was introduced by genetic contact with South Asia and strong demographic events in isolated local groups.},

At this point, a complex history of migration is thought to have begun with the arrival of people sharing ancestry with Near Oceanic groups (i.e., Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking groups), and was then followed by the arrival of non-Oceanic groups during European colonialism. However, the specifics of this peopling are not entirely clear from the archaeological and anthropological records, and is therefore a focus of continued debate. To shed additional light on the Samoan population history that this peopling reflects, we employ a population genetic approach to analyze 1,197 Samoan high-coverage whole genomes. We identify population splits between the major Samoan islands and detect asymmetrical gene flow to the capital city. We also find an extreme bottleneck until about 1,000 y ago, which is followed by distinct expansions across the islands and subsequent bottlenecks consistent with European colonization. These results provide for an increased understanding of Samoan population history and the dynamics that inform it, and also demonstrate how rapid demographic processes can shape modern genomes.},

            The settlement of Sahul, the lost continent of Oceania, remains one of the most ancient and debated human migrations. Modern New Guineans inherited a unique genetic diversity tracing back 50,000 years, and yet there is currently no model reconstructing their past population dynamics. We generated 58 new whole-genome sequences from Papua New Guinea, filling geographical gaps in previous sampling, specifically to address alternative scenarios of the initial migration to Sahul and the settlement of New Guinea. Here, we present the first genomic models for the settlement of northeast Sahul considering one or two migrations from Wallacea. Both models fit our data set, reinforcing the idea that ancestral groups to New Guinean and Indigenous Australians split early, potentially during their migration in Wallacea where the northern route could have been favored. The earliest period of human presence in Sahul was an era of interactions and gene flow between related but already differentiated groups, from whom all modern New Guineans, Bismarck islanders, and Indigenous Australians descend. The settlement of New Guinea was probably initiated from its southeast region, where the oldest archaeological sites have been found. This was followed by two migrations into the south and north lowlands that ultimately reached the west and east highlands. We also identify ancient gene flows between populations in New Guinea, Australia, East Indonesia, and the Bismarck Archipelago, emphasizing the fact that the anthropological landscape during the early period of Sahul settlement was highly dynamic rather than the traditional view of extensive isolation.},

Hybrid offspring of different species are often unfit, and yet it has long been argued that introgression can be a potent force in evolution, especially in plants. Over the last two decades, genomic data have increasingly provided evidence that introgression is a critically important source of genetic variation and that this additional variation can be useful in adaptive evolution of both animals and plants. Here, we review factors that influence the probability that foreign genetic variants provide long-term benefits (so-called adaptive introgression) and discuss their potential benefits. We find that introgression plays an important role in adaptive evolution, particularly when a species is far from its fitness optimum, such as when they expand their range or are subject to changing environments.},

To date, studies of positive selection have primarily relied upon genomic datasets from contemporary populations, which are susceptible to confounding factors associated with complex and often unknown aspects of population history. In particular, admixture between diverged populations can distort or hide prior selection events in modern genomes, though this process is not explicitly accounted for in most selection studies despite its apparent ubiquity in humans and other species. Through analyses of ancient and modern human genomes, we show that previously reported Holocene-era admixture has masked more than 50 historic hard sweeps in modern European genomes. Our results imply that this canonical mode of selection has likely been underappreciated in the evolutionary history of humans and suggests that our current understanding of the tempo and mode of selection in natural populations may be quite inaccurate.},

They started to appear in the fossil record outside of Africa as early as 100 thousand years ago, although other hominins existed throughout Eurasia much earlier. Recently, several studies argued in favor of a single out of Africa event for modern humans on the basis of whole-genome sequence analyses. However, the single out of Africa model is in contrast with some of the ﬁndings from fossil records, which support two out of Africa events, and uniparental data, which propose a back to Africa movement. Here, we used a deep-learning approach coupled with approximate Bayesian computation and sequential Monte Carlo to revisit these hypotheses from the whole-genome sequence perspective. Our results support the back to Africa model over other alternatives. We estimated that there are two sequential separations between Africa and out of African populations happening around 60-90 thousand years ago and separated by 13-15 thousand years. One of the populations resulting from the more recent split has replaced the older West African population to a large extent, while the other one has founded the out of Africa populations.},

            qpAdm is a statistical tool for studying the ancestry of populations with histories that involve admixture between two or more source populations. Using qpAdm, it is possible to identify plausible models of admixture that fit the population history of a group of interest and to calculate the relative proportion of ancestry that can be ascribed to each source population in the model. Although qpAdm is widely used in studies of population history of human (and nonhuman) groups, relatively little has been done to assess its performance. We performed a simulation study to assess the behavior of qpAdm under various scenarios in order to identify areas of potential weakness and establish recommended best practices for use. We find that qpAdm is a robust tool that yields accurate results in many cases, including when data coverage is low, there are high rates of missing data or ancient DNA damage, or when diploid calls cannot be made. However, we caution against co-analyzing ancient and present-day data, the inclusion of an extremely large number of reference populations in a single model, and analyzing population histories involving extended periods of gene flow. We provide a user guide suggesting best practices for the use of qpAdm.},

	abstract = {The question of the relative evolutionary roles of adaptive and nonadaptive processes has been a central debate in population genetics for nearly a century. While advances have been made in the theoretical development of the underlying models, and statistical methods for estimating their parameters from large-scale genomic data, a framework for an appropriate null model remains elusive. A model incorporating evolutionary processes known to be in constant operation, genetic drift (as modulated by the demographic history of the population) and purifying selection, is lacking. Without such a null model, the role of adaptive processes in shaping within- and between-population variation may not be accurately assessed. Here, we investigate how population size changes and the strength of purifying selection affect patterns of variation at “neutral” sites near functional genomic components. We propose a novel statistical framework for jointly inferring the contribution of the relevant selective and demographic parameters. By means of extensive performance analyses, we quantify the utility of the approach, identify the most important statistics for parameter estimation, and compare the results with existing methods. Finally, we reanalyze genome-wide population-level data from a Zambian population of Drosophila melanogaster, and ﬁnd that it has experienced a much slower rate of population growth than was inferred when the effects of purifying selection were neglected. Our approach represents an appropriate null model, against which the effects of positive selection can be assessed.},

We show how the two most widely used approaches to modeling population structure, admixture-based models and principal components analysis (PCA), can be viewed within a single unifying framework of matrix factorization. Specifically, they can both be interpreted as approximating an observed genotype matrix by a product of two lower-rank matrices, but with different constraints or prior distributions on these lower-rank matrices. This opens the door to a large range of possible approaches to analyzing population structure, by considering other constraints or priors. In this paper, we introduce one such novel approach, based on sparse factor analysis (SFA). We investigate the effects of the different types of constraint in several real and simulated data sets. We find that SFA produces similar results to admixture-based models when the samples are descended from a few well-differentiated ancestral populations and can recapitulate the results of PCA when the population structure is more ‘‘continuous,’’ as in isolation-by-distance models.},

	abstract = {The field of population genomics has grown rapidly with the recent advent of affordable, large-scale sequencing technologies. As opposed to the situation during the majority of the 20th century, in which the development of theoretical and statistical population-genetic insights out-paced the generation of data to which they could be applied, genomic data are now being produced at a far greater rate than they can be meaningfully analyzed and interpreted. With this wealth of data has come a tendency to focus on fitting specific (and often rather idiosyncratic) models to data, at the expense of a careful exploration of the range of possible underlying evolutionary processes. For example, the approach of directly investigating models of adaptive evolution in each newly sequenced population or species often neglects the fact that a thorough characterization of ubiquitous non-adaptive processes is a prerequisite for accurate inference. We here describe the perils of these tendencies, present our views on current best practices in population genomic data analysis, and highlight areas of statistical inference and theory that are in need of further attention. Thereby, we argue for the importance of defining a biologically relevant baseline model tuned to the details of each new analysis, of skepticism and scrutiny in interpreting model-fitting results, and of carefully defining addressable hypotheses and underlying uncertainties.},

The patterns of Neandertal ancestry in modern humans have been used to estimate that this is the result of gene ﬂow that occurred during the expansion of modern humans into Eurasia, but the precise dates of this event remain largely unknown. Here, we introduce an extended admixture pulse model that allows joint estimation of the timing and duration of gene ﬂow. This model leads to simple expressions for both the admixture segment distribution and the decay curve of ancestry linkage disequilibrium, and we show that these two statistics are closely related. In simulations, we ﬁnd that estimates of the mean time of admixture are largely robust to details in gene ﬂow models, but that the duration of the gene ﬂow can only be recovered if gene ﬂow is very recent and the exact recombination map is known. These results imply that gene ﬂow from Neandertals into modern humans could have happened over hundreds of generations. Ancient genomes from the time around the admixture event are thus likely required to resolve the question when, where, and for how long humans and Neandertals interacted.},

A useful methodological framework for this purpose is F-statistics that measure shared genetic drift between sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between populations. This article provides context from phylogenetic and population genetic theory. I review how F-statistics can be interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under different models of population structure and show how population substructure complicates inference. The results lead to simpliﬁed estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replace F3 with the average number of pairwise differences for estimating population divergence.},

In this study, we sequence 150 genomes to high coverage combined with an additional 130 genotype array samples from Native American and mestizo populations in Peru. The majority of our samples possess greater than 90\% Native American ancestry, which makes this the most extensive Native American sequencing project to date. Demographic modeling reveals that the peopling of Peru began ∼12,000 y ago, consistent with the hypothesis of the rapid peopling of the Americas and Peruvian archeological data. We find that the Native American populations possess distinct ancestral divisions, whereas the mestizo groups were admixtures of multiple Native American communities that occurred before and during the Inca Empire and Spanish rule. In addition, the mestizo communities also show Spanish introgression largely following Peruvian Independence, nearly 300 y after Spain conquered Peru. Further, we estimate migration events between Peruvian populations from all three geographic regions with the majority of between-region migration moving from the high Andes to the low-altitude Amazon and coast. As such, we present a detailed model of the evolutionary dynamics which impacted the genomes of modern-day Peruvians and a Native American ancestry dataset that will serve as a beneficial resource to addressing the underrepresentation of Native American ancestry in sequencing studies.},

Here, we test a new explanation that mutation accumulation due to small population size or a history of range expansion can contribute to restricting distributions by reducing population growth rate at the edge. We examined genomic diversity and mutational load across the entire geographic range of the North American plant Arabidopsis lyrata, including old, isolated populations predominantly at the southern edge and regions of postglacial range expansion at the northern and southern edges. Genomic diversity in intergenic regions declined toward distribution edges and signatures of mutational load in exon regions increased. Genomic signatures of mutational load were highly linked to phenotypically expressed load, measured as reduced performance of individual plants and lower estimated rate of population growth. The geographic pattern of load and the connection between load and population growth demonstrate that mutation accumulation reduces ﬁtness at the edge and helps restrict species’ distributions.},

Thus, estimates of the proportion of moderately to strongly deleterious new mutations may be unreliable because such variants are unlikely to be segregating in the data. Additionally, the true functional form of the DFE is unknown, and estimates of the DFE differ signiﬁcantly between studies. Here we present a ﬂexible and computationally tractable method, called Fit@a@i, to estimate the DFE of new mutations using the site frequency spectrum from a large number of individuals. We apply our approach to the frequency spectrum of 1300 Europeans from the Exome Sequencing Project ESP6400 data set, 1298 Danes from the LuCamp data set, and 432 Europeans from the 1000 Genomes Project to estimate the DFE of deleterious nonsynonymous mutations. We infer signiﬁcantly fewer (0.38–0.84 fold) strongly deleterious mutations with selection coefﬁcient {\textbar}s{\textbar} . 0.01 and more (1.24–1.43 fold) weakly deleterious mutations with selection coefﬁcient {\textbar}s{\textbar} , 0.001 compared to previous estimates. Furthermore, a DFE that is a mixture distribution of a point mass at neutrality plus a gamma distribution ﬁts better than a gamma distribution in two of the three data sets. Our results suggest that nearly neutral forces play a larger role in human evolution than previously thought.},

	abstract = {The Out-of-Africa (OOA) dispersal ∼50,000 y ago is characterized by a series of founder events as modern humans expanded into multiple continents. Population genetics theory predicts an increase of mutational load in populations undergoing serial founder effects during range expansions. To test this hypothesis, we have sequenced full genomes and high-coverage exomes from seven geographically divergent human populations from Namibia, Congo, Algeria, Pakistan, Cambodia, Siberia, and Mexico. We find that individual genomes vary modestly in the overall number of predicted deleterious alleles. We show via spatially explicit simulations that the observed distribution of deleterious allele frequencies is consistent with the OOA dispersal, particularly under a model where deleterious mutations are recessive. We conclude that there is a strong signal of purifying selection at conserved genomic positions within Africa, but that many predicted deleterious mutations have evolved as if they were neutral during the expansion out of Africa. Under a model where selection is inversely related to dominance, we show that OOA populations are likely to have a higher mutation load due to increased allele frequencies of nearly neutral variants that are recessive or partially recessive.},

	abstract = {Although range expansions have occurred recurrently in the history of most species, their genetic consequences have been little investigated. Theoretical studies show that range expansions are quite different from pure demographic expansions and that the extent of recent gene ﬂow conditions expected patterns of molecular diversity within and between populations. Spatially explicit simulation studies have led to unexpected and fascinating results about genetic patterns emerging after a range expansion. For instance, spatial expansions can generate allele frequency gradients, promote the surfing of rare variants into newly occupied territories, induce the structuring of newly colonized areas into distinct sectors of low genetic diversity, or lead to massive introgression of local genes into the genome of an invading species. Interestingly, most of these patterns had been previously attributed to distinct selective processes, showing that taking into account the dynamic nature of a species range can lead to a paradigm shift in our perception of evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {Most human populations exhibit an excess of high-frequency variants, leading to a U-shaped site-frequency spectrum (uSFS). This pattern has been generally interpreted as a signature of ongoing episodes of positive selection, or as evidence for a mis-assignment of ancestral/derived allelic states, but uSFS has also been observed in populations receiving gene flow from a ghost population, in structured populations, or after range expansions. In order to better explain the prevalence of high-frequency variants in humans and other populations, we describe here which patterns of gene flow and population demography can lead to uSFS by using extensive coalescent simulations. We find that uSFS can often be observed in a population if gene flow brings a few ancestral alleles from a well-differentiated population. Gene flow can either consist in single pulses of admixture or continuous immigration, but different demographic conditions are necessary to observe uSFS in these two scenarios. Indeed, an extremely low and recent gene flow is required in the case of single admixture events, while with continuous immigration, uSFS occurs only if gene flow started recently at a high rate or if it lasted for a long time at a low rate. Overall, we find that a neutral uSFS occurs under more restrictive conditions in populations having received single pulses of gene flow than in populations exposed to continuous gene flow. We also show that the uSFS observed in human populations from the 1000 Genomes Project can easily be explained by gene flow from surrounding populations without requiring past episodes of positive selection. These results imply that uSFS should be common in non-isolated populations, such as most wild or domesticated plants and animals.},

	abstract = {Language evolution is traditionally described in terms of family trees with ancestral languages splitting into descendent languages. However, it has long been recognized that language evolution also entails horizontal components, most commonly through lexical borrowing. For example, the English language was heavily influenced by Old Norse and Old French; eight per cent of its basic vocabulary is borrowed. Borrowing is a distinctly non-tree-like process—akin to horizontal gene transfer in genome evolution—that cannot be recovered by phylogenetic trees. Here, we infer the frequency of hidden borrowing among 2346 cognates (etymologically related words) of basic vocabulary distributed across 84 Indo-European languages. The dataset includes 124 (5\%) known borrowings. Applying the uniformitarian principle to inventory dynamics in past and present basic vocabularies, we find that 1373 (61\%) of the cognates have been affected by borrowing during their history. Our approach correctly identified 117 (94\%) known borrowings. Reconstructed phylogenetic networks that capture both vertical and horizontal components of evolutionary history reveal that, on average, eight per cent of the words of basic vocabulary in each Indo-European language were involved in borrowing during evolution. Basic vocabulary is often assumed to be relatively resistant to borrowing. Our results indicate that the impact of borrowing is far more widespread than previously thought.},

	abstract = {We here present two methods for inferring population structure and admixture proportions in low-depth next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Inference of population structure is essential in both population genetics and association studies, and is often performed using principal component analysis (PCA) or clustering-based approaches. NGS methods provide large amounts of genetic data but are associated with statistical uncertainty, especially for low-depth sequencing data. Models can account for this uncertainty by working directly on genotype likelihoods of the unobserved genotypes. We propose a method for inferring population structure through PCA in an iterative heuristic approach of estimating individual allele frequencies, where we demonstrate improved accuracy in samples with low and variable sequencing depth for both simulated and real datasets. We also use the estimated individual allele frequencies in a fast non-negative matrix factorization method to estimate admixture proportions. Both methods have been implemented in the PCAngsd framework available at http://www.popgen.dk/software/.},

	abstract = {Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have dramatically revolutionised research in many fields of genetics. The ability to sequence many individuals from one or multiple populations at a genomic scale has greatly enhanced population genetics studies and made it a data-driven discipline. Recently, researchers have proposed statistical modelling to address genotyping uncertainty associated with NGS data. However, an ongoing debate is whether it is more beneficial to increase the number of sequenced individuals or the per-sample sequencing depth for estimating genetic variation. Through extensive simulations, I assessed the accuracy of estimating nucleotide diversity, detecting polymorphic sites, and predicting population structure under different experimental scenarios. Results show that the greatest accuracy for estimating population genetics parameters is achieved by employing a large sample size, despite single individuals being sequenced at low depth. Under some circumstances, the minimum sequencing depth for obtaining accurate estimates of allele frequencies and to identify polymorphic sites is 2X , where both alleles are more likely to have been sequenced. On the other hand, inferences of population structure are more accurate at very large sample sizes, even with extremely low sequencing depth. This all points to the conclusion that under various experimental scenarios, in cost-limited population genetics studies, large sample sizes at low sequencing depth are desirable to achieve high accuracy. These findings will help researchers design their experimental set-ups and guide further investigation on the effect of protocol design for genetic research.},

However, sequencing costs often set limits to the amount of sequences that can be generated and, consequently, the biological outcomes that can be achieved from an experimental design. In this Review, we discuss the issue of sequencing depth in the design of next-generation sequencing experiments. We review current guidelines and precedents on the issue of coverage, as well as their underlying considerations, for four major study designs, which include de novo genome sequencing, genome resequencing, transcriptome sequencing and genomic location analyses (for example, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) and chromosome conformation capture (3C)).},

In turn, genomes from ancient human archaeological remains are now easier than ever to obtain, and provide a direct window into changes in frequencies of trait-associated alleles in the past. This has generated a new wave of studies aiming to analyse the genetic component of traits in historic and prehistoric times using ancient DNA, and to determine whether any such traits were subject to natural selection. In humans, however, issues about the portability and robustness of complex trait inference across different populations are particularly concerning when predictions are extended to individuals that died thousands of years ago, and for which little, if any, phenotypic validation is possible. In this review, we discuss the advantages of incorporating ancient genomes into studies of trait-associated variants, the need for models that can better accommodate ancient genomes into quantitative genetic frameworks, and the existing limits to inferences about complex trait evolution, particularly with respect to past populations.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research ﬁndings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientiﬁc ﬁeld. In this framework, a research ﬁnding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a ﬁeld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater ﬂexibility in designs, deﬁnitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater ﬁnancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientiﬁc ﬁeld in chase of statistical signiﬁcance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientiﬁc ﬁelds, claimed research ﬁndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

Here we consider the effect of relatively recent population structure and gene ﬂow and interpret genomes of individuals that have ancestry from multiple source populations as mosaics of segments originating from each population. This article describes general and tractable models for local ancestry patterns with a focus on the length distribution of continuous ancestry tracts and the variance in total ancestry proportions among individuals. The models offer improved agreement with Wright–Fisher simulation data when compared to the state-of-the art and can be used to infer timedependent migration rates from multiple populations. Considering HapMap African-American (ASW) data, we ﬁnd that a model with two distinct phases of “European” gene ﬂow signiﬁcantly improves the modeling of both tract lengths and ancestry variances.},

	abstract = {The archipelago of Vanuatu has been at the crossroads of human population movements in the Paciﬁc for the past three millennia. To help address several open questions regarding the history of these movements, we generated genome-wide data for 11 ancient individuals from the island of Efate dating from its earliest settlement to the recent past, including ﬁve associated with the Chief Roi Mata’s Domain World Heritage Area, and analyzed them in conjunction with 34 published ancient individuals from Vanuatu and elsewhere in Oceania, as well as present-day populations. Our results outline three distinct periods of population transformations. First, the four earliest individuals, from the Lapita-period site of Teouma, are concordant with eight previously described Lapita-associated individuals from Vanuatu and Tonga in having almost all of their ancestry from a ‘‘First Remote Oceanian’’ source related to East and Southeast Asians. Second, both the Papuan ancestry predominating in Vanuatu for the past 2,500 years and the smaller component of Papuan ancestry found in Polynesians can be modeled as deriving from a single source most likely originating in New Britain, suggesting that the movement of people carrying this ancestry to Remote Oceania closely followed that of the First Remote Oceanians in time and space. Third, the Chief Roi Mata’s Domain individuals descend from a mixture of Vanuatu- and Polynesian-derived ancestry and are related to Polynesian-inﬂuenced communities today in central, but not southern, Vanuatu, demonstrating Polynesian genetic input in multiple groups with independent histories.},

One of the major achievements of recent Lapita research in Vanuatu has been the discovery of the oldest cemetery found so far in the Pacific at Teouma on the south coast of Efate Island, opening up new prospects for the biological definition of the early settlers of the archipelago and of Remote Oceania in general. Using craniometric evidence from the skeletons in conjunction with archaeological data, we discuss here four debated issues: the Lapita–Asian connection, the degree of admixture, the Lapita–Polynesian connection, and the question of secondary population movement into Remote Oceania.},

Some 5500 years ago, the Ta Pen Keng (TPK) culture, attested on the Peng Hu islands off the shore of Fujian, apparently represents an incoming Neolithic population. Similar TPK sites are recorded around the shores of Taiwan in the centuries immediately following this. The pervasive assumption has been that these early settlers were the bearers of the Austronesian languages, which then diversified. If so, related Austronesian languages were formerly spoken on the Chinese mainland and these subsequently disappeared as a consequence of the Sinitic expansions.},

Here, we report the earliest figurative stone carving and formally manufactured pestles in Oceania, dating to 5050 to 4200 years ago.

	abstract = {The timing of human colonization of East Polynesia, a vast area lying between Hawai‘i, Rapa Nui, and New Zealand, is much debated and the underlying causes of this great migration have been enigmatic. Our study generates evidence for human dispersal into eastern Polynesia from islands to the west from around AD 900 and contemporaneous paleoclimate data from the likely source region. Lake cores from Atiu, Southern Cook Islands (SCIs) register evidence of pig and/or human occupation on a virgin landscape at this time, followed by changes in lake carbon around AD 1000 and significant anthropogenic disturbance from c. AD 1100. The broader paleoclimate context of these early voyages of exploration are derived from the Atiu lake core and complemented by additional lake cores from Samoa (directly west) and Vanuatu (southwest) and published hydroclimate proxies from the Society Islands (northeast) and Kiribati (north). Algal lipid and leaf wax biomarkers allow for comparisons of changing hydroclimate conditions across the region before, during, and after human arrival in the SCIs. The evidence indicates a prolonged drought in the likely western source region for these colonists, lasting c. 200 to 400 y, contemporaneous with the phasing of human dispersal into the Pacific. We propose that drying climate, coupled with documented social pressures and societal developments, instigated initial eastward exploration, resulting in SCI landfall(s) and return voyaging, with colonization a century or two later. This incremental settlement process likely involved the accumulation of critical maritime knowledge over several generations.},

              The peopling of Sahul (the combined continent of Australia and New Guinea) represents the earliest continental migration and settlement event of solely anatomically modern humans, but its patterns and ecological drivers remain largely conceptual in the current literature. We present an advanced stochastic-ecological model to test the relative support for scenarios describing where and when the first humans entered Sahul, and their most probable routes of early settlement. The model supports a dominant entry via the northwest Sahul Shelf first, potentially followed by a second entry through New Guinea, with initial entry most consistent with 50,000 or 75,000 years ago based on comparison with bias-corrected archaeological map layers. The model’s emergent properties predict that peopling of the entire continent occurred rapidly across all ecological environments within 156–208 human generations (4368–5599 years) and at a plausible rate of 0.71–0.92 km year
              −1
              . More broadly, our methods and approaches can readily inform other global migration debates, with results supporting an exit of anatomically modern humans from Africa 63,000–90,000 years ago, and the peopling of Eurasia in as little as 12,000–15,000 years via inland routes.},

Although mobility within this territory is unrestricted, it ceases to be so beyond the « frontiers ». The rigid control exerted by each group on the section of territory that belongs to it results in a control over external mobility and hence involves an ideology of «fixation» or implantation. The territorial fixation, often justified by reference to a mythological origin that is also a cosmogony, forms the basis of land rights and entrenches the various clans constituting the social group. From this perspective, traditional society can be defined as a fundamentally stable grouping that rigidly controls the relationships of each of its members with the outside world. However, this does not necessarily mean that external journey or mobility is unknown or even uncommon; indeed, in the northern islands, the relationships of alliance or business arising from the exchange and loan of pigs — the basis of the grade system — often involved long and frequent journeys outside the territory. But each of these outside links needed to follow a number of norms in order to exist : the Big Men and the men of power had the « ex-officio » privilege of an external relationship and therefore of mobility. The latter, as far as it existed, remained socially formalized and geographically fragmented.},

Although this is clearly true in a small number of cases, its explanatory value has been undermined by the difficulties of validating it in many situations.

	abstract = {Background: The human history of Oceania comprises two extremes: the initial colonizations of Near Oceania, one of the oldest out-of-Africa migrations, and of Remote Oceania, the most recent expansion into unoccupied territories. Genetic studies, mostly using uniparentally inherited DNA, have shed some light on human origins in Oceania, particularly indicating that Polynesians are of mixed East Asian and Near Oceanian ancestry. Here, we use w1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate the demographic history of Oceania in a more detailed manner.
Results: We developed a new approach to account for SNP ascertainment bias, used approximate Bayesian computation simulations to choose the best-ﬁtting model of population history, and estimated demographic parameters. We ﬁnd that the ancestors of Near Oceanians diverged from ancestral Eurasians w27 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting separate initial occupations of both territories. The genetic admixture in Polynesian history between East Asians (w87\%) and Near Oceanians (w13\%) occurred w3 kya, prior to the colonization of Polynesia. Fijians are of Polynesian (w65\%) and additional Near Oceanian (w35\%) ancestry not found in Polynesians, with this admixture occurring considerably after the initial settlement of Remote Oceania. Our data support a greater contribution of East Asian women than men in the admixture history of Remote Oceania and highlight population substructure in Polynesia and New Guinea.
Conclusions: Despite the inherent ascertainment bias, genome-wide SNP data provide new insights into the genetic history of Oceana. Our approach to correct for ascertainment bias and obtain reliable inferences concerning demographic history should prove useful in other such studies.},

We illustrate the importance of conducting QC at each stage of an RNA-seq experiment and demonstrate our recommended RNA-seq QC strategy. Furthermore, we discuss the major and often neglected quality issues associated with the three major types of RNA-seq: mRNA, total RNA and small RNA.

	abstract = {Retroviruses are genome invaders that have shared a long history of coevolution with vertebrates and their immune system. Found endogenously in genomes as traces of past invasions, retroviruses are also considerable threats to human health when they exist as exogenous viruses such as HIV. The immune response to retroviruses is engaged by germline-encoded sensors of innate immunity that recognize viral components and damage induced by the infection. This response develops with the induction of antiviral effectors and launching of the clonal adaptive immune response, which can contribute to protective immunity. However, retroviruses efﬁciently evade the immune response, owing to their rapid evolution. The failure of specialized immune cells to respond, a form of neglect, may also contribute to inadequate antiretroviral immune responses. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which immune responses to retroviruses are mounted at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. We also discuss how intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immunity may cooperate or conﬂict during the generation of immune responses.},

	abstract = {Background: RNA-Seq has supplanted microarrays as the preferred method of transcriptome-wide identification of differentially expressed genes. However, RNA-Seq analysis is still rapidly evolving, with a large number of tools available for each of the three major processing steps: read alignment, expression modeling, and identification of differentially expressed genes. Although some studies have benchmarked these tools against gold standard gene expression sets, few have evaluated their performance in concert with one another. Additionally, there is a general lack of testing of such tools on real-world, physiologically relevant datasets, which often possess qualities not reflected in tightly controlled reference RNA samples or synthetic datasets.
Results: Here, we evaluate 219 combinatorial implementations of the most commonly used analysis tools for their impact on differential gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq. A test dataset was generated using highly purified human classical and nonclassical monocyte subsets from a clinical cohort, allowing us to evaluate the performance of 495 unique workflows, when accounting for differences in expression units and gene- versus transcript-level estimation. We find that the choice of methodologies leads to wide variation in the number of genes called significant, as well as in performance as gauged by precision and recall, calculated by comparing our RNA-Seq results to those from four previously published microarray and BeadChip analyses of the same cell populations. The method of differential gene expression identification exhibited the strongest impact on performance, with smaller impacts from the choice of read aligner and expression modeler. Many workflows were found to exhibit similar overall performance, but with differences in their calibration, with some biased toward higher precision and others toward higher recall.
Conclusions: There is significant heterogeneity in the performance of RNA-Seq workflows to identify differentially expressed genes. Among the higher performing workflows, different workflows exhibit a precision/recall tradeoff, and the ultimate choice of workflow should take into consideration how the results will be used in subsequent applications. Our analyses highlight the performance characteristics of these workflows, and the data generated in this study could also serve as a useful resource for future development of software for RNA-Seq analysis.},

	abstract = {Background: The Bovine HapMap Consortium has generated assay panels to genotype {\textasciitilde}30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 501 animals sampled from 19 worldwide taurine and indicine breeds, plus two outgroup species (Anoa and Water Buffalo). Within the larger set of SNPs we targeted 101 high density regions spanning up to 7.6 Mb with an average density of approximately one SNP per 4 kb, and characterized the linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype block structure within individual breeds and groups of breeds in relation to their geographic origin and use.
Results: From the 101 targeted high-density regions on bovine chromosomes 6, 14, and 25, between 57 and 95\% of the SNPs were informative in the individual breeds. The regions of high LD extend up to {\textasciitilde}100 kb and the size of haplotype blocks ranges between 30 bases and 75 kb (10.3 kb average). On the scale from 1–100 kb the extent of LD and haplotype block structure in cattle has high similarity to humans. The estimation of effective population sizes over the previous 10,000 generations conforms to two main events in cattle history: the initiation of cattle domestication ({\textasciitilde}12,000 years ago), and the intensification of population isolation and current population bottleneck that breeds have experienced worldwide within the last {\textasciitilde}700 years. Haplotype block density correlation, block boundary discordances, and haplotype sharing analyses were consistent in revealing unexpected similarities between some beef and dairy breeds, making them nondifferentiable. Clustering techniques permitted grouping of breeds into different clades given their similarities and dissimilarities in genetic structure.
Conclusion: This work presents the first high-resolution analysis of haplotype block structure in worldwide cattle samples. Several novel results were obtained. First, cattle and human share a high similarity in LD and haplotype block structure on the scale of 1–100 kb. Second, unexpected similarities in haplotype block structure between dairy and beef breeds make them nondifferentiable. Finally, our findings suggest that {\textasciitilde}30,000 uniformly distributed SNPs would be necessary to construct a complete genome LD map in Bos taurus breeds, and {\textasciitilde}580,000 SNPs would be necessary to characterize the haplotype block structure across the complete cattle genome.},

	abstract = {Highly expressed genes in many bacteria and small eukaryotes often have a strong compositional bias, in terms of codon usage. Two widely used numerical indices, the codon adaptation index (CAI) and the codon usage, use this bias to predict the expression level of genes. When these indices were ®rst introduced, they were based on fairly simple assumptions about which genes are most highly expressed: the CAI was originally based on the codon composition of a set of only 24 highly expressed genes, and the codon usage on assumptions about which functional classes of genes are highly expressed in fast-growing bacteria. Given the recent advent of genomewide expression data, we should be able to improve on these assumptions. Here, we measure, in yeast, the degree to which consideration of the current genome-wide expression data sets improves the performance of both numerical indices. Indeed, we ®nd that by changing the parameterization of each model its correlation with actual expression levels can be somewhat improved, although both indices are fairly insensitive to the exact way they are parameterized. This insensitivity indicates a consistent codon bias amongst highly expressed genes. We also attempt direct linear regression of codon composition against genome-wide expression levels (and protein abundance data). This has some similarity with the CAI formalism and yields an alternative model for the prediction of expression levels based on the coding sequences of genes.

Here we I performed codon usage bias and comparative genomic analyses using whole genome R and expression data of three Echinococcus species. The study of 4,710,883 codons, two C orders of magnitude more than in previous research works, showed that the codon usage S in Echinococcus genes is biased towards the pyrimidines T and C ending codons, with an average effective number of codons equal to 57 revealing a low codon usage bias. U The gene annotations and the expression profile of 7613 genes allowed to accurately N determine 27 optimal codons for the Echinococcus species, most of them ending in G/C. A Approximately the 30\% of Echinococcus genes analysed exhibits higher codon usage M bias as well as a higher expression profile. Neutrality-plots demonstrated that the selection pressure is the main evolutionary force shaping the codon usage with a contribution of 80\%. Comparative genome analyses among several tapeworm species D revealed that codon usage patterns are a conserved trait in cestodes parasites. Since E cestodes parasites take advantage of the host protein synthesis pathways, this study T could provide valuable information associated with the parasite-host relationship that P would be useful to determine which host’s factors are relevant for shaping the codon E usage.},

For modern datasets, eQTL analysis is a computationally intensive task as it involves testing for association of billions of transcript-SNP (singlenucleotide polymorphism) pair. The heavy computational burden makes eQTL analysis less popular and sometimes forces analysts to restrict their attention to just a small subset of transcript-SNP pairs. As more transcripts and SNPs get interrogated over a growing number of samples, the demand for faster tools for eQTL analysis grows stronger.},

	abstract = {Bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a common virus of cattle globally, was believed for decades not to infect humans. More recent techniques (in situ PCR and DNA sequencing) enabled detection of BLV in human breast tissue, and determination of its significant association with breast cancer in a US population. Using similar techniques to study 96 Australian women, we report here detection of retrotranscribed BLV DNA in breast tissue of 40/50(80\%) of women with breast cancer versus 19/46(41\%) of women with no history of breast cancer, indicating an age-adjusted odds ratio and confidence interval of 4.72(1.71–13.05). These results corroborate the findings of the previous study of US women with an even higher odds ratio for the Australian population. For 48 of the subjects, paired breast tissue samples, removed 3–10 years apart in two unrelated procedures, were available. For 23/31 (74\%) of these, in which the first specimen was diagnosed as nonmalignant (benign or premalignant) and the second as malignant, BLV was already present in benign breast tissue years 3–10 years before the malignancy was diagnosed. This is consistent with the supposition of a causative temporal relationship between BLV infection and subsequent development of cancer.},

	abstract = {In recent years genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous chromosomal loci associated with various electrocardiographic traits and cardiac arrhythmia predisposition. A considerable fraction of these loci lie within inter-genic regions. The underlying trait-associated variants likely reside in regulatory regions and exert their effect by modulating gene expression. Hence, the key to unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying these cardiac traits is to interrogate variants for association with differential transcript abundance by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis. In this study we conducted an eQTL analysis of human heart. For a total of 129 left ventricular samples that were collected from non-diseased human donor hearts, genome-wide transcript abundance and genotyping was determined using microarrays. Each of the 18,402 transcripts and 897,683 SNP genotypes that remained after pre-processing and stringent quality control were tested for eQTL effects. We identified 771 eQTLs, regulating 429 unique transcripts. Overlaying these eQTLs with cardiac GWAS loci identified novel candidates for studies aimed at elucidating the functional and transcriptional impact of these loci. Thus, this work provides for the first time a comprehensive eQTL map of human heart: a powerful and unique resource that enables systems genetics approaches for the study of cardiac traits.},

	abstract = {The genetic basis of gene expression variation has long been studied with the aim to understand the landscape of regulatory variants, but also more recently to assist in the interpretation and elucidation of disease signals. To date, many studies have looked in specific tissues and population-based samples, but there has been limited assessment of the degree of inter-population variability in regulatory variation. We analyzed genome-wide gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a total of 726 individuals from 8 global populations from the HapMap3 project and correlated gene expression levels with HapMap3 SNPs located in cis to the genes. We describe the influence of ancestry on gene expression levels within and between these diverse human populations and uncover a non-negligible impact on global patterns of gene expression. We further dissect the specific functional pathways differentiated between populations. We also identify 5,691 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) after controlling for both non-genetic factors and population admixture and observe that half of the cis-eQTLs are replicated in one or more of the populations. We highlight patterns of eQTL-sharing between populations, which are partially determined by population genetic relatedness, and discover significant sharing of eQTL effects between Asians, European-admixed, and African subpopulations. Specifically, we observe that both the effect size and the direction of effect for eQTLs are highly conserved across populations. We observe an increasing proximity of eQTLs toward the transcription start site as sharing of eQTLs among populations increases, highlighting that variants close to TSS have stronger effects and therefore are more likely to be detected across a wider panel of populations. Together these results offer a unique picture and resource of the degree of differentiation among human populations in functional regulatory variation and provide an estimate for the transferability of complex trait variants across populations.},

However, BLV is estimated to cost the dairy industry hundreds of millions of dollars annually and this is likely a conservative estimate. BLV is not thought to cause animal distress or serious pathology unless infection progresses to leukemia or lymphoma. However, a wealth of research supports the notion that BLV infection causes widespread abnormal immune function. BLV infection can impact cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system and alter proper functioning of uninfected cells. Despite strong evidence of abnormal immune signaling and functioning, little research has investigated the large-scale effects of BLV infection on host immunity and resistance to other infectious diseases. This review focuses on mechanisms of immune suppression associated with BLV infection, speciﬁcally aberrant signaling, proliferation and apoptosis, and the implications of switching from BLV latency to activation. In addition, this review will highlight underdeveloped areas of research relating to BLV infection and how it causes immune suppression.},

While the culture of penaeid shrimp has increased markedly, the industry continues to be impeded in many regards by disease, reproductive dysfunction, and a poor understanding of production traits. Extensive effort has been, and continues to be, applied to develop critical genomic resources for many commercially important penaeids. However, the industry application of these genomic resources, and the translation of the knowledge derived from “omics” studies has not yet been completely realized. Integration between the multiple “omics” resources now available (i.e., genome assemblies, transcriptomes, linkage maps, optical maps, and proteomes) will prove critical to unlocking the full utility of these otherwise independently developed and isolated resources. Furthermore, emerging “omics” based techniques are now available to address longstanding issues with completing keystone genome assemblies (e.g., through long-read sequencing), and can provide cost-effective industrial scale genotyping tools (e.g., through low density SNP chips and genotype-by-sequencing) to undertake advanced selective breeding programs (i.e., genomic selection) and powerful genome-wide association studies. In particular, this review highlights the status, utility and suggested path forward for continued development, and improved use of “omics” resources in penaeid aquaculture.},

Genetics can be haploid, diploid, or otherwise; reproduction can be asexual or sexual. Biological events (e.g. births, deaths, mating, dispersal) depend in arbitrary fashion on the current population state. Our formalism is based on the idea of genetic sites. Each genetic site resides at a particular locus and houses a single allele. Each individual contains a number of sites equal to its ploidy (one for haploids, two for diploids, etc.). Selection occurs via replacement events, in which alleles in some sites are replaced by copies of others. Replacement events depend stochastically on the population state, leading to a Markov chain representation of natural selection. Within this formalism, we deﬁne reproductive value, ﬁtness, neutral drift, and ﬁxation probability, and prove relationships among them. We identify four criteria for evaluating which allele is selected and show that these become equivalent in the limit of low mutation. We then formalize the method of weak selection. The power of our formalism is illustrated with applications to evolutionary games on graphs and to selection in a haplodiploid population.},

Here, we review recent experimental progress in areas as different as the evolution of drug resistance in cancer cells and the rewiring of transcriptional regulation circuits in vertebrates. This research reveals the importance of three major themes: multiple genetic and non-g enetic mechanisms to generate phenotypic diversity , robustness in genetic systems, and adaptive landscape topography. We also discuss the mounting evidence that evolvability can evolve and the question of whether it evolves adaptively.},

This disease is known to have a negative impact on dairy cattle production and, because no treatment or vaccine is available, ﬁnding a possible genetic solution is important. Our objective was to perform a comprehensive genetic analysis of leukosis incidence in dairy cattle. Data on leukosis occurrence, pedigree and molecular information were combined into multitrait GBLUP models with milk yield (MY) and somatic cell score (SCS) to estimate genetic parameters and to perform whole-genome scans and pathway analysis. Leukosis data were available for 11 554 Holsteins daughters of 3002 sires from 112 herds in 16 US states. Genotypes from a 60K SNP panel were available for 961 of those bulls as well as for 2039 additional bulls. Heritability for leukosis incidence was estimated at about 8\%, and the genetic correlations of leukosis disease incidence with MY and SCS were moderate at 0.18 and 0.20 respectively. The genome-wide scan indicated that leukosis is a complex trait, possibly modulated by many genes. The gene set analysis identiﬁed many functional terms that showed signiﬁcant enrichment of genes associated with leukosis. Many of these terms, such as G-Protein Coupled Receptor Signaling Pathway, Regulation of Nucleotide Metabolic Process and different calcium-related processes, are known to be related to retrovirus infection. Overall, our ﬁndings contribute to a better understanding of the genetic architecture of this complex disease. The functional categories associated with leukosis may be useful in future studies on ﬁne mapping of genes and development of dairy cattle breeding strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection is omnipresent in dairy herds causing direct economic losses due to trade restrictions and lymphosarcoma-related deaths. Milk production drops and increase in the culling rate are also relevant and usually neglected. The BLV provirus persists throughout a lifetime and an inter-individual variation is observed in the level of infection (LI) in vivo. High LI is strongly correlated with disease progression and BLV transmission among herd mates. In a context of high prevalence, classical control strategies are economically prohibitive. Alternatively, host genomics studies aiming to dissect loci associated with LI are potentially useful tools for genetic selection programs tending to abrogate the viral spreading. The LI was measured through the proviral load (PVL) set–point and white blood cells (WBC) counts. The goals of this work were to gain insight into the contribution of SNPs (bovine 50KSNP panel) on LI variability and to identify genomics regions underlying this trait.
Results: We quantified anti–p24 response and total leukocytes count in peripheral blood from 1800 cows and used these to select 800 individuals with extreme phenotypes in WBCs and PVL. Two case-control genomic association studies using linear mixed models (LMMs) considering population stratification were performed. The proportion of the variance captured by all QC-passed SNPs represented 0.63 (SE ± 0.14) of the phenotypic variance for PVL and 0. 56 (SE ± 0.15) for WBCs. Overall, significant associations (Bonferroni’s corrected -log10p {\textgreater} 5.94) were shared for both phenotypes by 24 SNPs within the Bovine MHC. Founder haplotypes were used to measure the linkage disequilibrium (LD) extent (r2 = 0.22 ± 0.27 at inter-SNP distance of 25−50 kb). The SNPs and LD blocks indicated genes potentially associated with LI in infected cows: i.e. relevant immune response related genes (DQA1, DRB3, BOLA-A, LTA, LTB, TNF, IER3, GRP111, CRISP1), several genes involved in cell cytoskeletal reorganization (CD2AP, PKHD1, FLOT1, TUBB5) and modelling of the extracellular matrix (TRAM2, TNXB). Host transcription factors (TFs) were also highlighted (TFAP2D; ABT1, GCM1, PRRC2A).
Conclusions: Data obtained represent a step forward to understand the biology of BLV–bovine interaction, and provide genetic information potentially applicable to selective breeding programs.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the majority of cancers result from multiple cellular events leading to malignancy after a prolonged period of clinical latency, and that the immune system plays a critical role in the control of cancer progression. Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is an oncogenic member of the Retroviridae family. Complete genomic sequences of BLV strains isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from cattle have been previously reported. However, a detailed characterization of the complete genome of BLV strains directly isolated from bovine tumors is much needed in order to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis induced by BLV in cattle. In this study, we performed a molecular characterization of BLV complete genomes from bovine B-cell lymphosarcoma isolates. A nucleotide substitution was found in the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) site of the 5' long terminal repeat (5'LTR) of the BLV isolates. All amino acid substitutions in Tax previously found to be related to stimulate high transcriptional activity of 5'LTR were not found in these studies. Amino acid substitutions were found in the nucleocapsid, gp51 and G4 proteins. Premature stop-codons in R3 were observed. Few mutations or amino acid substitutions may be needed to allow BLV provirus to achieve silencing. Substitutions that favor suppression of viral expression in malignant B cells might be a strategy to circumvent effective immune attack.},

	abstract = {Background: Analyses of DNA sequences from cultivated microorganisms have revealed genome-wide, taxa-specific nucleotide compositional characteristics, referred to as genome signatures. These signatures have far-reaching implications for understanding genome evolution and potential application in classification of metagenomic sequence fragments. However, little is known regarding the distribution of genome signatures in natural microbial communities or the extent to which environmental factors shape them.
Results: We analyzed metagenomic sequence data from two acidophilic biofilm communities, including composite genomes reconstructed for nine archaea, three bacteria, and numerous associated viruses, as well as thousands of unassigned fragments from strain variants and lowabundance organisms. Genome signatures, in the form of tetranucleotide frequencies analyzed by emergent self-organizing maps, segregated sequences from all known populations sharing {\textless} 50 to 60\% average amino acid identity and revealed previously unknown genomic clusters corresponding to low-abundance organisms and a putative plasmid. Signatures were pervasive genome-wide. Clusters were resolved because intra-genome differences resulting from translational selection or protein adaptation to the intracellular (pH {\textasciitilde}5) versus extracellular (pH {\textasciitilde}1) environment were small relative to inter-genome differences. We found that these genome signatures stem from multiple influences but are primarily manifested through codon composition, which we propose is the result of genome-specific mutational biases.
Conclusions: An important conclusion is that shared environmental pressures and interactions among coevolving organisms do not obscure genome signatures in acid mine drainage communities. Thus, genome signatures can be used to assign sequence fragments to populations, an essential prerequisite if metagenomics is to provide ecological and biochemical insights into the functioning of microbial communities.},

	abstract = {There is a family of proteins from parasitic worms which combine N-terminal EF-hand domains with C-terminal dynein light chain-like domains. Data are accumulating on the biochemistry and cell biology of these proteins. However, little is known about their functions in vivo. Schistosoma mansoni expresses 13 family members (SmTAL1–SmTAL13). Three of these (SmTAL1, SmTAL2 and SmTAL3) have been subjected to biochemical analysis which demonstrated that they have different molecular properties. Although their overall folds are predicted to be similar, small changes in the EF-hand domains result in differences in their ion binding properties. Whereas SmTAL1 and SmTAL2 are able to bind calcium (and some other) ions, SmTAL3 appears to be unable to bind any divalent cations. Similar biochemical diversity has been seen in the CaBP proteins from Fasciola hepatica. Four family members are known (FhCaBP1–4). All of these bind to calcium ions. However, FhCaBP4 dimerizes in the presence of calcium ions, FhCaBP3 dimerizes in the absence of calcium ions and FhCaBP2 dimerizes regardless of the prevailing calcium ion concentration. In both the SmTAL and FhCaBP families, the proteins also differ in their ability to bind calmodulin antagonists and related drugs. Interestingly, SmTAL1 interacts with praziquantel (the drug of choice for treating schistosomiasis). The pharmacological signiﬁcance (if any) of this ﬁnding is unknown.},

	abstract = {A DNA sequence encoding a protein with predicted EF-hand and dynein light chain binding domains was identiﬁed in a Fasciola hepatica EST library. Sequence analysis of the encoded protein revealed that the most similar known protein was the Fasciola gigantica protein FgCaBP3 and so this newly identiﬁed protein was named FhCaBP3. Molecular modelling of FhCaBP3 predicted a highly ﬂexible N-terminal region, followed by a domain containing two EF-hand motifs the second of which is likely to be a functioning divalent ion binding site. The C-terminal domain of the protein contains a dynein light chain like region. Interestingly, molecular modelling predicts that calcium ion binding to the N-terminal domain destabilises the b-sheet structure of the C-terminal domain. FhCaBP3 can be expressed in, and puriﬁed from, Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein dimerises and the absence of calcium ions appeared to promote dimerisation. Native gel shift assays demonstrated that the protein bound to calcium and manganese ions, but not to magnesium, barium, zinc, strontium, nickel, copper or cadmium ions. FhCaBP3 interacted with the calmodulin antagonists triﬂuoperazine, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1naphthalenesulfonamide and chlorpromazine as well as the myosin regulatory light chain-binding drug praziquantel. Despite sequence and structural similarities to other members of the same protein family from F. hepatica, FhCaBP3 has different biochemical properties to the other well characterised family members, FH22 and FhCaBP4. This suggests that each member of this trematode calcium-binding family has discrete functional roles within the organism.},

	abstract = {Complexity of biological function relies on large networks of interacting molecules. However, the evolutionary properties of these networks are not fully understood. It has been shown that selective pressures depend on the position of genes in the network. We have previously shown that in the Drosophila insulin/target of rapamycin (TOR) signal transduction pathway there is a correlation between the pathway position and the strength of purifying selection, with the downstream genes being most constrained. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of this well-characterized pathway in vertebrates. More speciﬁcally, we determined the impact of natural selection on the evolution of 72 genes of this pathway. We found that in vertebrates there is a similar gradient of selective constraint in the insulin/TOR pathway to that found in Drosophila. This feature is neither the result of a polarity in the impact of positive selection nor of a series of factors affecting selective constraint levels (gene expression level and breadth, codon bias, protein length, and connectivity). We also found that pathway genes encoding physically interacting proteins tend to evolve under similar selective constraints. The results indicate that the architecture of the vertebrate insulin/TOR pathway constrains the molecular evolution of its components. Therefore, the polarity detected in Drosophila is neither speciﬁc nor incidental of this genus. Hence, although the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear, these may be similar in both vertebrates and Drosophila.},

	abstract = {Background: A valuable tool for both research and industry, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has applications range from gamete selection and preservation of traits to cloning. Although IVF has achieved worldwide use, with approximately 339,685 bovine embryos transferred in 2010 alone, there are still continuing difficulties with efficiency. It is rare to have more than 40\% of fertilized in vitro cattle oocytes reach blastocyst stage by day 8 of culture, and pregnancy rates are reported as less than 45\% for in vitro produced embryos. To investigate potential influences in-vitro fertilization (IVF) has on embryonic development, this study compares in vivo- and in vitroderived bovine blastocysts at a similar stage and quality grade (expanded, excellent quality) to determine the degree of transcriptomic variation beyond morphology using RNA-Seq.
Results: A total of 26,906,451 and 38,184,547 fragments were sequenced for in vitro and in vivo embryo pools, respectively. We detected expression for a total of 17,634 genes, with 793 genes showing differential expression between the two embryo populations with false discovery rate (FDR) {\textless} 0.05. There were also 395 novel transcribed units found, of which 45 were differentially expressed (FDR {\textless} 0.05). In addition, 4,800 genes showed evidence of alternative splicing, with 873 genes displaying differential alternative splicing between the two pools (FDR {\textless} 0.05). Using GO enrichment analysis, multiple biological pathways were found to be significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes (FDR {\textless} 0.01), including cholesterol and sterol synthesis, system development, and cell differentiation.
Conclusions: Thus, our results support that IVF may influence at the transcriptomic level and that morphology is limited in full characterization of bovine preimplantation embryos.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of maternal methionine supplementation on the transcriptome of bovine preimplantation embryos. Holstein cows were randomly assigned to one of two treatments differing in level of dietary methionine (1.89 Met vs. 2.43 Met \% of metabolizable protein) from calving until embryo flushing. High quality preimplantation embryos from individual cows were pooled and then analyzed by RNA sequencing. Remarkably, a subtle difference in methionine supplementation in maternal diet was sufficient to cause significant changes in the transcriptome of the embryos. A total of 276 genes out of 10,662 showed differential expression between treatments (FDR ,0.10). Interestingly, several of the most significant genes are related to embryonic development (e.g., VIM, IFI6, BCL2A1, and TBX15) and immune response (e.g., NKG7, TYROBP, SLAMF7, LCP1, and BLA-DQB). Likewise, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that several Gene Ontology terms, InterPro entries, and KEGG pathways were enriched (FDR ,0.05) with differentially expressed genes involved in embryo development and immune system. The expression of most genes was decreased by maternal methionine supplementation, consistent with reduced transcription of genes with increased methylation of specific genes by increased methionine. Overall, our findings provide evidence that supplementing methionine to dams prior to conception and during the preimplantation period can modulate gene expression in bovine blastocysts. The ramifications of the observed gene expression changes for subsequent development of the pregnancy and physiology of the offspring warrant further investigation in future studies.},

	abstract = {The trematode Schistosoma mansoni is a causative agent of schistosomiasis, the second most common parasitic disease of humans after malaria. Calcium homeostasis and calcium-mediated signalling pathways are of particular interest in this species. The drug of choice for treating schistosomiasis, praziquantel, disrupts the regulation of calcium uptake and there is interest in exploiting calcium-mediated processes for future drug discovery. Calmodulin is a calcium sensing protein, present in most eukaryotes. It is a critical regulator of processes as diverse as muscle contraction, cell division and, partly through interaction with voltage-gated calcium channels, intra-cellular calcium concentrations. S. mansoni expresses two highly similar calmodulins – SmCaM1 and SmCaM2. Both proteins interact with calcium, manganese, cadmium (II), iron (II) and lead ions in native gel electrophoresis. These ions also cause conformational changes in the proteins resulting in the exposure of a more hydrophobic surface (as demonstrated by anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate ﬂuorescence assays). The proteins are primarily dimeric in the absence of calcium ions, but monomeric in the presence of this ion. Both SmCaM1 and SmCaM2 interact with a peptide corresponding to an IQ-motif derived from the α-subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel SmCav1B (residues 1923–1945). Both proteins bound with slightly higher aﬃnity in the presence of calcium ions. However, there was no diﬀerence between the aﬃnities of the two proteins for the peptide. This interaction could be antagonised by chlorpromazine and triﬂuoperazine, but not praziquantel or thiamylal. Interestingly no interaction could be detected with the other three IQ-motifs identiﬁed in S. mansoni voltage-gated ion calcium channels.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years, the use of genomic information in livestock species for genetic improvement, association studies and many other fields has become routine. In order to accommodate different market requirements in terms of genotyping cost, manufacturers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, private companies and international consortia have developed a large number of arrays with different content and different SNP density. The number of currently available SNP arrays differs among species: ranging from one for goats to more than ten for cattle, and the number of arrays available is increasing rapidly. However, there is limited or no effort to standardize and integrate array- specific (e.g. SNP IDs, allele coding) and species-specific (i.e. past and current assemblies) SNP information.
Results: Here we present SNPchiMp v.3, a solution to these issues for the six major livestock species (cow, pig, horse, sheep, goat and chicken). Original data was collected directly from SNP array producers and specific international genome consortia, and stored in a MySQL database. The database was then linked to an open-access web tool and to public databases. SNPchiMp v.3 ensures fast access to the database (retrieving within/across SNP array data) and the possibility of annotating SNP array data in a user-friendly fashion.
Conclusions: This platform allows easy integration and standardization, and it is aimed at both industry and research. It also enables users to easily link the information available from the array producer with data in public databases, without the need of additional bioinformatics tools or pipelines. In recognition of the open-access use of Ensembl resources, SNPchiMp v.3 was officially credited as an Ensembl E!mpowered tool. Availability at http://bioinformatics.tecnoparco.org/ SNPchimp.},

The drug praziquantel (PZQ) is the mainstay therapy but the target of this drug remains ambiguous. While PZQ paralyses and kills parasitic schistosomes, in free-living planarians PZQ caused an unusual axis duplication during regeneration to yield two-headed animals. Here, we show that PZQ activation of a neuronal Ca2+ channel modulates opposing dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways to regulate ‘head’ structure formation. Surprisingly, compounds with efficacy for either bioaminergic network in planarians also displayed antischistosomal activity, and reciprocally, agents first identified as antischistocidal compounds caused bipolar regeneration in the planarian bioassay. These divergent outcomes (death versus axis duplication) result from the same Ca2+ entry mechanism, and comprise unexpected Ca2+ phenologs with meaningful predictive value. Surprisingly, basic research into axis patterning mechanisms provides an unexpected route for discovering novel antischistosomal agents.},

This theory makes no assumptions about diﬀerences in means between the sexes, nor does it presume that one sex is selective and the other non-selective.

	abstract = {Background: Fasciola hepatica is the main agent of fasciolosis, a zoonotic disease affecting livestock worldwide, and an emerging food-borne disease in humans. Even when effective treatments are available, drugs are costly and can result in tolerance, liver damage and normally they do not prevent reinfection. Drug-resistant strains in livestock have been reported in various countries and, more worryingly, drug resistance in human cases has emerged in South America. The present study aims to characterize the transcriptome of two South American resistant isolates, the Cajamarca isolate from Peru, resistant to both triclabendazole and albendazole (TCBZR/ABZR) and the Rubino isolate from Uruguay, resistant to ABZ (TCBZS/ABZR), and compare them to a sensitive strain (Cenapa, Mexico, TCBZS/ABZS) to reveal putative molecular mechanisms leading to drug resistance.
Results: We observed a major reduction in transcription in the Cajamarca TCBZR/ABZR isolate in comparison to the other isolates. While most of the differentially expressed genes are still unannotated, several trends could be detected. Specific reduction in the expression levels of cytoskeleton proteins was consistent with a role of tubulins as putative targets of triclabendazole (TCBZ). A marked reduction of adenylate cyclase might be underlying pleiotropic effects on diverse metabolic pathways of the parasite. Upregulation of GST mu isoforms suggests this detoxifying mechanism as one of the strategies associated with resistance.
Conclusions: Our results stress the value of transcriptomic approaches as a means of providing novel insights to advance the understanding of drug mode of action and drug resistance. The results provide evidence for pleiotropic variations in drug-resistant isolates consistent with early observations of TCBZ and ABZ effects and recent proteomic findings.},

	abstract = {Background: Alternative splicing (AS) is a primary mechanism of functional regulation in the human genome, with 60\% to 80\% of human genes being alternatively spliced. As part of the bovine genome annotation team, we have analysed 4567 bovine AS genes, compared to 16715 human and 16491 mouse AS genes, along with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. We also analysed the two most important events, cassette exons and intron retention in 94 human disease genes and mapped them to the bovine orthologous genes. Of the 94 human inherited disease genes, a protein domain analysis was carried out for the transcript sequences of 12 human genes that have orthologous genes and have been characterised in cow.
Results: Of the 21,755 bovine genes, 4,567 genes (21\%) are alternatively spliced, compared to 16,715 (68\%) in human and 16,491 (57\%) in mouse. Gene-level analysis of the orthologous set suggested that bovine genes show fewer AS events compared to human and mouse genes. A detailed examination of cassette exons across human and cow for 94 human disease genes, suggested that a majority of cassette exons in human were present and constitutive in bovine as opposed to intron retention which exhibited 50\% of the exons as present and 50\% as absent in cow. We observed that AS plays a major role in disease implications in human through manipulations of essential/functional protein domains. It was also evident that majority of these 12 genes had conservation of all essential domains in their bovine orthologous counterpart, for these human diseases.
Conclusion: While alternative splicing has the potential to create many mRNA isoforms from a single gene, in cow the majority of genes generate two to three isoforms, compared to six in human and four in mouse. Our analyses demonstrated that a smaller number of bovine genes show greater transcript diversity. GO definitions for bovine AS genes provided 38\% more functional information than currently available in the sequence database. Our protein domain analysis helped us verify the suitability of using bovine as a model for human diseases and also recognize the contribution of AS towards the disease phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Class I and II aaRS recognition of opposite grooves was likely among the earliest determinants ﬁxed in the tRNA acceptor stem bases. A new regression model identiﬁes those determinants in bacterial tRNAs. Integral coefﬁcients relate digital dependent to independent variables with perfect agreement between observed and calculated grooves for all twenty isoaccepting tRNAs. Recognition is mediated by the Discriminator base 73, the ﬁrst base pair, and base 2 of the acceptor stem. Subsets of these coefﬁcients also identically compute grooves recognized by smaller numbers of aaRS. Thus, the model is hierarchical, suggesting that new rules were added to pre-existing ones as new amino acids joined the coding alphabet. A thermodynamic rationale for the simplest model implies that Class-dependent aaRS secondary structures exploited differential tendencies of the acceptor stem to form the hairpin observed in Class I aaRS•tRNA complexes, enabling the earliest groove discrimination. Curiously, groove recognition also depends explicitly on the identity of base 2 in a manner consistent with the middle bases of the codon table, conﬁrming a hidden ancestry of codonanticodon pairing in the acceptor stem. That, and the lack of correlation with anticodon bases support prior productive coding interaction of tRNA minihelices with proto-mRNA.},

Cellular metabolism is probably one of the most ancient biological networks and constitutes a good model system for the study of network evolution. While many evolutionary models have been proposed, a substantial body of work suggests metabolic pathways evolve fundamentally by recruitment, in which enzymes are drawn from close or distant regions of the network to perform novel chemistries or use different substrates. Here we review how structural and functional genomics has impacted our knowledge of evolution of modern metabolism and describe some approaches that merge evolutionary and structural genomics with advances in bioinformatics. These include mining the data on structure and function of enzymes for salient patterns of enzyme recruitment. Initial studies suggest modern metabolism originated in enzymes of nucleotide metabolism harboring the P-loop hydrolase fold, probably in pathways linked to the purine metabolic subnetwork. This gateway of recruitment gave rise to pathways related to the synthesis of nucleotides and cofactors for an ancient RNA world. Once the TIM ␤/␣-barrel fold architecture was discovered, it appears metabolic activities were recruited explosively giving rise to subnetworks related to carbohydrate and then amino acid metabolism. Remarkably, recruitment occurred in a layered system reminiscent of Morowitz’s prebiotic shells, supporting the notion that modern metabolism represents a palimpsest of ancient metabolic chemistries.},

Constructing and querying sufﬁx arrays is reduced to a sort and search paradigm that employs novel algorithms. The main advantage of sufﬁx arrays over sufﬁx trees is that, in practice, they use three to ﬁve times less space. From a complexity standpoint, sufﬁx arrays permit on-line string searches of the type, ‘‘Is W a substring of A?’’ to be answered in time O(P + log N), where P is the length of W and N is the length of A, which is competitive with (and in some cases slightly better than) sufﬁx trees. The only drawback is that in those instances where the underlying alphabet is ﬁnite and small, sufﬁx trees can be constructed in O(N) time in the worst case, versus O(N log N) time for sufﬁx arrays. However, we give an augmented algorithm that, regardless of the alphabet size, constructs sufﬁx arrays in O(N) expected time, albeit with lesser space efﬁciency. We believe that sufﬁx arrays will prove to be better in practice than sufﬁx trees for many applications.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a rapidly evolving set of technologies that can be used to determine the sequence of an individual's genome1  by calling genetic variants present in an individual using billions of short, errorful sequence reads2 . Despite more than a decade of effort and thousands of dedicated researchers, the hand-crafted and parameterized statistical models used for variant calling still produce thousands of errors and missed variants in each genome3 ,4. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network5  can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships (likelihoods) between images of read pileups around putative variant sites and ground-truth genotype calls. This approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing tools, even winning the "highest performance" award for SNPs in a FDA-administered variant calling challenge. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and even to other mammalian species, allowing non-human sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground truth data. We further show that, unlike existing tools which perform well on only a specific technology, DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, from deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics to Ion Ampliseq exomes. DeepVariant represents a significant step from expert-driven statistical modeling towards more automatic deep learning approaches for developing software to interpret biological instrumentation data.},

It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample sizeis small, and decreases slowlyas the samplesizeincreases.Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level.A simple method of computer simulation, that was used inorder toobtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophilamelanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion ({\textgreater}lo0 bp) is deleterious. It i s suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

The calculated distribution of minor allele frequencies and heterozygosities suggested that the genetic diversity of Bos indicus populations was lower than that of Bos taurus populations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the main divergence between the Bos taurus and Bos indicus populations, and subsequently between Asian and European populations. By principal components analysis, the Bos taurus and Bos indicus populations were clearly distinguished with PC1 (61.1\%); however, six Bos taurus populations clustered loosely and the partial separation between European and Asian groups was observed by PC2 (12.5\%). The structure analysis was performed using the STRUCTURE program. Distinct separation between Bos taurus and Bos indicus was shown at K = 2, and that between European and Asian populations at K = 3. At K = 4, 5 and 6, Mongolian population showed an admixture pattern with different ancestry of Asian and European cattle. At K = 7, all Bos taurus populations showed each cluster with little proportion of admixture. In conclusion, 58 SNP markers in this study could sufﬁciently estimate the genetic diversity, relationship and structure for nine Eurasian cattle populations, especially by analyses of principal components and STRUCTURE.},

	abstract = {Background: Identifying recent positive selection signatures in domesticated animals could provide information on genome response to strong directional selection from domestication and artificial selection. With the completion of the cattle genome, private companies are now providing large numbers of polymorphic markers for probing variation in domestic cattle (Bos taurus). We analysed over 7,500 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in beef (Angus) and dairy (Holstein) cattle and outgroup species Bison, Yak and Banteng in an indirect test of inbreeding and positive selection in Domestic cattle.
Results: Outgroup species: Bison, Yak and Banteng, were genotyped with high levels of success (90\%) and used to determine ancestral and derived allele states in domestic cattle. Frequency spectrums of the derived alleles in Angus and Holstein were examined using Fay and Wu's H test. Significant divergences from the predicted frequency spectrums expected under neutrality were identified. This appeared to be the result of combined influences of positive selection, inbreeding and ascertainment bias for moderately frequent SNP. Approximately 10\% of all polymorphisms identified as segregating in B. taurus were also segregating in Bison, Yak or Banteng; highlighting a large number of polymorphisms that are ancient in origin.
Conclusion: These results suggest that a large effective population size (Ne) of approximately 90,000 or more existed in B. taurus since they shared a common ancestor with Bison, Yak and Banteng {\textasciitilde}1–2 million years ago (MYA). More recently Ne decreased sharply probably associated with domestication. This may partially explain the paradox of high levels of polymorphism in Domestic cattle and the relatively small recent Ne in this species. The period of inbreeding caused Fay and Wu's H statistic to depart from its expectation under neutrality mimicking the effect of selection. However, there was also evidence for selection, because high frequency derived alleles tended to cluster near each other on the genome.},

There are few reported studies on analysis strategies to maximize the yield of quality RNA-seq SNP data. We evaluated the performance of different SNP-calling methods following alignment to both genome and transcriptome by applying them to RNA-seq data from a HapMap lymphoblastoid cell line sample and comparing results with sequence variation data from 1000 Genomes. We determined that the best method to achieve high specificity and sensitivity, and greatest number of SNP calls, is to remove duplicate sequence reads after alignment to the genome and to call SNPs using SAMtools. The accuracy of SNP calls is dependent on sequence coverage available. In terms of specificity, 89\% of RNA-seq SNPs calls were true variants where coverage is .10X. In terms of sensitivity, at .10X coverage 92\% of all expected SNPs in expressed exons could be detected. Overall, the results indicate that RNA-seq SNP data are a very useful by-product of sequence-based transcriptome analysis. If RNA-seq is applied to disease tissue samples and assuming that genes carrying mutations relevant to disease biology are being expressed, a very high proportion of these mutations can be detected.},

We detect chromosomal segments of Amerindian ancestry supporting the presence of indigenous genetic ancestry in living descendants. Speciﬁc haplotypes were found to be enriched in “Charrúas” and rare in the rest of the Amerindian groups studied. Some of these we interpret as the result of positive selection, as we identiﬁed selection signatures and they were located mostly within genes related to the infectivity of speciﬁc viruses. Historical records describe contacts of the Charrúas with other Amerindians, such as Guaraní, and patterns of genomic similarity observed here concur with genomic similarity between these groups. Less expected, we found a high genomic similarity of the Charrúas to Diaguita from Argentinian and Chile, which could be explained by geographically proximity. Finally, by ﬁtting admixture models of Amerindian and European ancestry for the Uruguayan population, we were able to estimate the timing of the ﬁrst pulse of admixture between European and Uruguayan indigenous peoples in approximately 1658 and the second migration pulse in 1683. Both dates roughly concurring with the Franciscan missions in 1662 and the foundation of the city of Colonia in 1680 by the Spanish.},

Because of the explosive growth of methods for assessing genetic variation at a fine scale, evolutionary biologists and human geneticists are increasingly exploiting linkage disequilibrium in order to understand past evolutionary and demographic events, to map genes that are associated with quantitative characters and inherited diseases, and to understand the joint evolution of linked sets of genes. This article introduces linkage disequilibrium, reviews the population genetic processes that affect it and describes some of its uses. At present, linkage disequilibrium is used much more extensively in the study of humans than in non-humans, but that is changing as technological advances make extensive genomic studies feasible in other species.},

We compared the efficacy of regression (linear regression or generalized linear regression [GLR] for continuous or categorical outcomes, respectively), random forests (RF) and multilayer neural networks (NN) to predict beef carcass weight (CW), age when finished (AS), fat deposition (FD), and carcass quality (CQ). The data analyzed contained information on over 4 million beef cattle from 5,204 farms, corresponding to 4.3\% of Brazil’s national production between 2014 and 2016. Explanatory variables were integrated from different data sources and encompassed animal traits, participation in a technical advising program, nutritional products sold to farms, economic variables related to beef production, month when finished, soil fertility, and climate in the location in which animals were raised. The training set was composed of information collected in 2014 and 2015, while the testing set had information recorded in 2016. After parameter tuning for each algorithm, models were used to predict the testing set. The best model to predict CW and AS was RF (CW: predicted root mean square error = 0.65, R2 = 0.61, and mean absolute error = 0.49; AS: accuracy = 28.7\%, Cohen’s kappa coefficient [Kappa] = 0.08). While the best approach for FD and CQ was GLR (accuracy = 45.7\%, Kappa = 0.05, and accuracy = 58.7\%, Kappa = 0.09, respectively). Across all models, there was a tendency for better performance with RF and regression and worse with NN. Animal category, nutritional plan, cattle sales price, participation in a technical advising program, and climate and soil in which animals were raised were deemed important for prediction of meat production and quality with regression and RF. The development of strategies for prediction of livestock production using real-world large-scale data will be core to projecting future trends and optimizing the allocation of resources at all levels of the production chain, rendering animal production more sustainable. Despite beef cattle production being a complex system, this analysis shows that by integrating different sources of data it is possible to forecast meat production and quality at the national level with moderate-high levels of accuracy.},

In the case of a neutral polymorphism, average heterozygosity will be reduced to an extent which varies with distance from the substituted locus. The aggregate eifect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 106 or more (and perhaps of 104 or more), this eifect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp (— Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size. I t follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron.},

Here, I discuss these models, ranging from selective sweeps in a panmictic population of constant size to evolutionary trafﬁc when simultaneous sweeps at multiple loci interfere, and emphasize the important role of demography and population structure in data analysis. In the past 10 years, soft sweeps that may arise after an environmental change from directional selection on standing variation have become a focus of population genetic research. In contrast to selective sweeps, they are caused by beneﬁcial alleles that were neutrally segregating in a population before the environmental change or were present at a mutation-selection balance in appreciable frequency.},

However, such comparisons are complicated by differences in sample sizes and the neutral correlation of allele frequencies across populations due to shared history and gene ﬂow. To overcome these difﬁculties, we have developed a Bayesian method that estimates the empirical pattern of covariance in allele frequencies between populations from a set of markers and then uses this as a null model for a test at individual SNPs. In our model the sample frequencies of an allele across populations are drawn from a set of underlying population frequencies; a transform of these population frequencies is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. We ﬁrst estimate the covariance matrix of this multivariate normal across loci using a Monte Carlo Markov chain. At each SNP, we then provide a measure of the support, a Bayes factor, for a model where an environmental variable has a linear effect on the transformed allele frequencies compared to a model given by the covariance matrix alone. This test is shown through power simulations to outperform existing correlation tests. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to identify SNPs with unusually large allele frequency differentiation and offers a powerful alternative to tests based on pairwise or global FST.

	abstract = {In population genomics studies, accounting for the neutral covariance structure across population allele frequencies is critical to improve the robustness of genome-wide scan approaches. Elaborating on the BayEnv model, this study investigates several modeling extensions (i) to improve the estimation accuracy of the population covariance matrix and all the related measures, (ii) to identify signiﬁcantly overly differentiated SNPs based on a calibration procedure of the XtX statistics, and (iii) to consider alternative covariate models for analyses of association with population-speciﬁc covariables. In particular, the auxiliary variable model allows one to deal with multiple testing issues and, providing the relative marker positions are available, to capture some linkage disequilibrium information. A comprehensive simulation study was carried out to evaluate the performances of these different models. Also, when compared in terms of power, robustness, and computational efﬁciency to ﬁve other state-of-the-art genome-scan methods (BayEnv2, BayScEnv, BayScan, FLK, and LFMM), the proposed approaches proved highly effective. For illustration purposes, genotyping data on 18 French cattle breeds were analyzed, leading to the identiﬁcation of 13 strong signatures of selection. Among these, four (surrounding the KITLG, KIT, EDN3, and ALB genes) contained SNPs strongly associated with the piebald coloration pattern while a ﬁfth (surrounding PLAG1) could be associated to morphological differences across the populations. Finally, analysis of Pool-Seq data from 12 populations of Littorina saxatilis living in two different ecotypes illustrates how the proposed framework might help in addressing relevant ecological issues in nonmodel species. Overall, the proposed methods deﬁne a robust Bayesian framework to characterize adaptive genetic differentiation across populations.

Simulations show that ABS performs at least as well as, and often better under model violations, than the complementary likelihood approach of 3P-CLR across diverse selection scenarios and parameter values. We first applied ABS to contemporary human genomic data to identify genes that may have been adaptive in ancestral East Asian populations, uncovering the wellestablished candidate EDAR, as well as a novel candidate SLC35F3, which encodes a putative thiamine transporter that may have been involved in adaptation to eating polished grains. Next, we performed scans with ancient European genomic data to reexamine evidence of recent positive selection in ancestral Europeans. The MCM6/LCT cluster and the SLC45A2 and HERC2 genes are strong outliers, agreeing with previous studies. Novel candidates, such as SLC30A9 and CYP1A2, may have been involved in adaptation to local nutrient sufficiency and lifestyle changes. Finally, we provide open-source software, CalcABS, which can perform genomic scans of ancestral sweeps with ABS from population allele frequency data.},

Here we develop a set of methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns and correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of “standardized allele frequencies” that allows investigators to apply tests of their choice to multiple populations while accounting for sampling and covariance due to population history. We illustrate this ﬁrst by showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to detect nonparametric correlations with environmental variables; these correlations are also less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test is conceptually related to FST and is shown to be more powerful, as we account for population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of population pools—a cost-efﬁcient way to estimate population allele frequencies, but one that introduces an additional level of sampling noise. The utility of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by reanalyzing human SNP data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel populations and pooled next-generation sequencing data from Atlantic herring.

We have analysed 8,525 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 84 individuals from four populations: African-American, European-American, Chinese and Japanese. Individual relationships were reconstructed using the allele sharing distance and the neighbour-joining tree making method. Trees show clear clustering according to population, with the root branching from the African-American clade. The African-American cluster is much less star-like than European-American and East Asian clusters, primarily because of admixture. Furthermore, on the East Asian branch, all ten Chinese individuals cluster together and all ten Japanese individuals cluster together. Using positional information, we demonstrate strong correlations between inter-marker distance and both locus-speciﬁc FST (the proportion of total variation due to differentiation) levels and branch lengths. Chromosomal maps of the distribution of locus-speciﬁc branch lengths were constructed by combining these data with other published SNP markers (total of 33,704 SNPs).

	abstract = {The identification of signatures of natural selection in genomic surveys has become an area of intense research, stimulated by the increasing ease with which genetic markers can be typed. Loci identified as subject to selection may be functionally important, and hence (weak) candidates for involvement in disease causation. They can also be useful in determining the adaptive differentiation of populations, and exploring hypotheses about speciation. Adaptive differentiation has traditionally been identified from differences in allele frequencies among different populations, summarised by an estimate of FST. Low outliers relative to an appropriate neutral population-genetics model indicate loci subject to balancing selection, whereas high outliers suggest adaptive (directional) selection. However, the problem of identifying statistically significant departures from neutrality is complicated by confounding effects on the distribution of FST estimates, and current methods have not yet been tested in large-scale simulation experiments. Here, we simulate data from a structured population at many unlinked, diallelic loci that are predominantly neutral but with some loci subject to adaptive or balancing selection. We develop a hierarchical-Bayesian method, implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and assess its performance in distinguishing the loci simulated under selection from the neutral loci. We also compare this performance with that of a frequentist method, based on moment-based estimates of FST . We find that both methods can identify loci subject to adaptive selection when the selection coefficient is at least five times the migration rate. Neither method could reliably distinguish loci under balancing selection in our simulations, even when the selection coefficient is twenty times the migration rate.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that admixture with archaic hominins played an important role in facilitating biological adaptations to new environments. For example, interbreeding with Denisovans facilitated the adaptation to high-altitude environments on the Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, the
              EPAS1
              gene, a transcription factor that regulates the response to hypoxia, exhibits strong signatures of both positive selection and introgression from Denisovans in Tibetan individuals. Interestingly, despite being geographically closer to the Denisova Cave, East Asian populations do not harbor as much Denisovan ancestry as populations from Melanesia. Recently, two studies have suggested two independent waves of Denisovan admixture into East Asians, one of which is shared with South Asians and Oceanians. Here, we leverage data from
              EPAS1
              in 78 Tibetan individuals to interrogate which of these two introgression events introduced the
              EPAS1
              beneficial sequence into the ancestral population of Tibetans, and we use the distribution of introgressed segment lengths at this locus to infer the timing of the introgression and selection event. We find that the introgression event unique to East Asians most likely introduced the beneficial haplotype into the ancestral population of Tibetans around 48,700 (16,000–59,500) y ago, and selection started around 9,000 (2,500–42,000) y ago. Our estimates suggest that one of the most convincing examples of adaptive introgression is in fact selection acting on standing archaic variation.},

	abstract = {Extra or missing chromosomes—a phenomenon termed aneuploidy—frequently arises during human meiosis and embryonic mitosis and is the leading cause of pregnancy loss, including in the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF). While meiotic aneuploidies a↵ect all cells and are deleterious, mitotic errors generate mosaicism, which may be compatible with healthy live birth. Large-scale abnormalities such as triploidy and haploidy also contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, but remain hidden from standard sequencing-based approaches to preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-A). The ability to reliably distinguish meiotic and mitotic aneuploidies, as well as abnormalities in genome-wide ploidy may thus prove valuable for enhancing IVF outcomes. Here, we describe a statistical method for distinguishing these forms of aneuploidy based on analysis of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data, which is the current standard in the ﬁeld. Our approach overcomes the sparse nature of the data by leveraging allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) measured in a population reference panel. The method, which we term LD-informed PGT-A (LD-PGTA), retains high accuracy down to coverage as low as 0.05⇥ and at higher coverage can also distinguish between meiosis I and meiosis II errors based on signatures spanning the centromeres. LD-PGTA provides fundamental insight into the origins of human chromosome abnormalities, as well as a practical tool with the potential to improve genetic testing during IVF.},

	abstract = {In many species, the Y (or W) sex chromosome is degenerate. Current theory proposes that this degeneration follows the arrest of recombination and results from the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to selective interference–the inefﬁcacy of natural selection on non-recombining genomic regions. This theory requires very few assumptions, but it does not robustly predict fast erosion of the Y (or W) in large populations or the stepwise degeneration of several small non-recombining strata. We propose a new mechanism for Y/W erosion that works over faster timescales, in large populations, and for small non-recombining regions (down to a single sex-linked gene). The mechanism is based on the instability and divergence of cis-regulatory sequences in non-recombining genome regions, which become selectively haploidized to mask deleterious mutations on coding sequences. This haploidization is asymmetric, because cis-regulators on the X cannot be silenced (otherwise there would be no expression in females). This process causes rapid Y/W degeneration and simultaneous evolution of dosage compensation, provided that autosomal trans-regulatory sequences with sex-limited effects are available to compensate for cis-regulatory divergence. Although this ‘‘degeneration by regulatory evolution’’ does not require selective interference, both processes may act in concert to further accelerate Y degeneration.},

On one hand, it is now possible to study various source populations before a particular admixture thanks to the developments in ancient DNA (aDNA) in the last decade. However, aDNA availability is limited to certain geographical regions and the sample sizes and quality of the data might not be sufﬁcient for selection analysis in many cases. In this study, we explore possible ways to improve detection of pre-admixture signals in admixed populations using a local ancestry inference approach. We used masked haplotypes for population branch statistic (PBS) and full haplotypes constructed following our approach from Yelmen et al. (2019) for cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH), utilizing forward simulations to test the power of our analysis. The PBS results on simulated data showed that using masked haplotypes obtained from ancestry deconvolution instead of the admixed population might improve detection quality. On the other hand, XP-EHH results using the admixed population were better compared with the local ancestry method. We additionally report correlation for XP-EHH scores between source and admixed populations, suggesting that haplotype-based approaches must be used cautiously for recently admixed populations. Additionally, we performed PBS on real South Asian populations masked with local ancestry deconvolution and report here the ﬁrst possible selection signals on the autochthonous South Asian component of contemporary South Asian populations.},

These bridging works, in addition to the review, become a shorthand characterization of the topic going forward and receive disproportionate attention.

Great ape genetic diversity and population history. Nature 499:471–475). We also identiﬁed species-speciﬁc recombination hotspots in each group using a modiﬁed LDhot framework, which greatly improves statistical power to detect hotspots at varying strengths. We show that fewer hotspots are shared among chimpanzee subspecies than within human populations, further narrowing the time scale of complete hotspot turnover. Further, using species-speciﬁc PRDM9 sequences to predict potential binding sites (PBS), we show higher predicted PRDM9 binding in recombination hotspots as compared to matched cold spot regions in multiple great ape species, including at least one chimpanzee subspecies. We found that correlations between broad-scale recombination rates decline more rapidly than nucleotide divergence between species. We also compared the skew of recombination rates at centromeres and telomeres between species and show a skew from chromosome means extending as far as 10–15 Mb from chromosome ends. Further, we examined broad-scale recombination rate changes near a translocation in gorillas and found minimal differences as compared to other great ape species perhaps because the coordinates relative to the chromosome ends were unaffected. Finally, on the basis of multiple linear regression analysis, we found that various correlates of recombination rate persist throughout the African great apes including repeats, diversity, and divergence. Our study is the ﬁrst to analyze within- and between-species genome-wide recombination rate variation in several close relatives.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Deﬁnitions of macroevolution fall into three categories: (1) evolution of taxa of supraspeciﬁc rank; (2) evolution on the grand time-scale; and (3) evolution that is guided by sorting of interspeciﬁc variation (as opposed to sorting of intraspeciﬁc variation in microevolution). Here, it is argued that only deﬁnition 3 allows for a consistent separation of macroevolution and microevolution. Using this deﬁnition, speciation has both microevolutionary and macroevolutionary aspects: the process of morphological transformation is microevolutionary, but the variation among species that it produces is macroevolutionary, as is the rate at which speciation occurs. Selective agents may have differential effects on intraspeciﬁc and interspeciﬁc variation, with three possible situations: effect at one level only, effect at both levels with the same polarity but potentially different intensity, and effects that oppose between levels. Whereas the impact of all selective agents is direct in macroevolution, microevolution requires intraspeciﬁc competition as a mediator between selective agents and evolutionary responses. This mediating role of intraspeciﬁc competition occurs in the presence of sexual reproduction and has therefore no analogue at the macroevolutionary level where species are the evolutionary units. Competition between species manifests both on the microevolutionary and macroevolutionary level, but with different effects. In microevolution, interspeciﬁc competition spurs evolutionary divergence, whereas it is a potential driver of extinction at the macroevolutionary level. Recasting the Red Queen hypothesis in a macroevolutionary framework suggests that the effects of interspeciﬁc competition result in a positive correlation between origination and extinction rates, conﬁrming empirical observations herein referred to as Stanley’s rule.},

              The complete assembly of each human chromosome is essential for understanding human biology and evolution
              1,2
              . Here we use complementary long-read sequencing technologies to complete the linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08-Mb centromeric α-satellite array, a 644-kb copy number polymorphism in the β-defensin gene cluster that is important for disease risk, and an 863-kb variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric α-satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order α-satellites enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization and methylation pattern of the centromere in a diploid human genome. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous centromere from chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the higher-order α-satellite structure evolved in the great ape ancestor with a layered symmetry, in which more ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally to monomeric α-satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric satellite DNA is accelerated by more than 2.2-fold compared to the unique portions of the genome, and this acceleration extends into the flanking sequence.},

	title = {Detecting {Selection} in {Population} {Trees}: {The} {Lewontin} and {Krakauer} {Test} {Extended}},
	abstract = {Detecting genetic signatures of selection is of great interest for many research issues. Common approaches to separate selective from neutral processes focus on the variance of FST across loci, as does the original Lewontin and Krakauer (LK) test. Modern developments aim to minimize the false positive rate and to increase the power, by accounting for complex demographic structures. Another stimulating goal is to develop straightforward parametric and computationally tractable tests to deal with massive SNP data sets. Here, we propose an extension of the original LK statistic (TLK), named TF–LK , that uses a phylogenetic estimation of the population’s kinship (F ) matrix, thus accounting for historical branching and heterogeneity of genetic drift. Using forward simulations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data under neutrality and selection, we conﬁrm the relative robustness of the LK statistic (TLK) to complex demographic history but we show that TF–LK is more powerful in most cases. This new statistic outperforms also a multinomial-Dirichlet-based model [estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)], when historical branching occurs. Overall, TF–LK detects 15–35\% more selected SNPs than TLK for low type I errors (P , 0.001). Also, simulations show that TLK and TF–LK follow a chi-square distribution provided the ancestral allele frequencies are not too extreme, suggesting the possible use of the chi-square distribution for evaluating signiﬁcance. The empirical distribution of TF–LK can be derived using simulations conditioned on the estimated F matrix. We apply this new test to pig breeds SNP data and pinpoint outliers using TF–LK, otherwise undetected using the less powerful TLK statistic. This new test represents one solution for compromise between advanced SNP genetic data acquisition and outlier analyses.},

We selected a set of 700 orthologous genes conserved in all species, measuring changes in GC content, codon, and amino acid usage in orthologous positions. Values of 3rd codon position GC spanned over a wide range, allowing to discriminate two distinctive clusters within freshwater turbellarians, Cestodes and Trematodes respectively. Furthermore, a hierarchical clustering of codon usage data differs remarkably from the phylogenetic tree. Additionally, we detected a synonymous codon usage bias that was more dramatic in extreme GC-poor or GC-rich genomes, i.e., GC-poor Schistosomes preferred to use AT-rich terminated synonymous codons, while GC-rich M. lignano showed the opposite behavior. Interestingly, these biases impacted the amino acidic usage, with preferred amino acids encoded by codons following the GC content trend. These are associated with non-synonymous substitutions at orthologous positions. The detailed analysis of the synonymous and non-synonymous changes provides evidence for a two-hit mechanism where both mutation and selection forces drive the diverse coding strategies of flatworms.},

	abstract = {Although the genome of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, was first made available in 2005, with additional strains reported later, the intrinsic genome complexity of this parasite (the abundance of repetitive sequences and genes organized in tandem) has traditionally hindered high-quality genome assembly and annotation. This also limits diverse types of analyses that require high degrees of precision. Long reads generated by third-generation sequencing technologies are particularly suitable to address the challenges associated with T. cruzi’s genome since they permit direct determination of the full sequence of large clusters of repetitive sequences without collapsing them. This, in turn, not only allows accurate estimation of gene copy numbers but also circumvents assembly fragmentation. Here, we present the analysis of the genome sequences of two T. cruzi clones: the hybrid TCC (TcVI) and the non-hybrid Dm28c (TcI), determined by PacBio Single Molecular Real-Time (SMRT) technology. The improved assemblies herein obtained permitted us to accurately estimate gene copy numbers, abundance and distribution of repetitive sequences (including satellites and retroelements). We found that the genome of T. cruzi is composed of a ‘core compartment’ and a ‘disruptive compartment’ which exhibit opposite GC content and gene composition. Novel tandem and dispersed repetitive sequences were identified, including some located inside coding sequences. Additionally, homologous chromosomes were separately assembled, allowing us to retrieve haplotypes as separate contigs instead of a unique mosaic sequence. Finally, manual annotation of surface multigene families, mucins and trans-sialidases allows now a better overview of these complex groups of genes.},

We use simulations to assess the power and accuracy of our method and apply it to seven of the strongest sweeps currently known in humans. We identify two genes, ASPM and PSCA, that are most likely affected by selection on standing variation; and we find three genes, ADH1B, LCT, and EDAR, in which the adaptive alleles seem to have swept from a new mutation. We also confirm evidence of selection for one further gene, TRPV6. In one gene, G6PD, neither neutral models nor models of selective sweeps fit the data, presumably because this locus has been subject to balancing selection.},

	abstract = {The R package pcadapt performs genome scans to detect genes under selection based on population genomic data. It assumes that candidate markers are outliers with respect to how they are related to population structure. Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not require grouping individuals into populations. Since its ﬁrst release, pcadapt has evolved in terms of both statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the ﬁrst version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other computer programs for genome scans (BayeScan, hapﬂk, OutFLANK, sNMF). We ﬁnd that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10\% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40\% of false discoveries. We also ﬁnd that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we ﬁnd that pcadapt and hapﬂk are the most powerful in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Under neutral theory, the level of polymorphism in an equilibrium population is expected to increase with population size. However, observed levels of diversity across metazoans vary only two orders of magnitude, while census population sizes (
            N
            
              c
            
            ) are expected to vary over several. This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is a longstanding enigma in evolutionary genetics known as Lewontin’s Paradox of Variation (1974). Since Lewontin’s observation, it has been argued that selection constrains diversity across species, yet tests of this hypothesis seem to fall short of explaining the orders-of-magnitude reduction in diversity observed in nature. In this work, I revisit Lewontin’s Paradox and assess whether current models of linked selection are likely to constrain diversity to this extent. To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population sizes across species, I combine genetic data from 172 metazoan taxa with estimates of census sizes from geographic occurrence data and population densities estimated from body mass. Next, I fit the relationship between previously-published estimates of genomic diversity and these approximate census sizes to quantify Lewontin’s Paradox. While previous across-taxa population genetic studies have avoided accounting for phylogenetic non-independence, I use phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the diversity census size relationship, estimate phylogenetic signal, and explore how diversity changes along the phylogeny. I consider whether the reduction in diversity predicted by models of recurrent hitch-hiking and background selection could explain the observed pattern of diversity across species. Since the impact of linked selection is mediated by recombination map length, I also investigate how map lengths vary with census sizes. I find species with large census sizes have shorter map lengths, leading these species to experience greater reductions in diversity due to linked selection. Even after using high estimates of the strength of sweeps and background selection, I find linked selection likely cannot explain the shortfall between predicted and observed diversity levels across metazoan species. Furthermore, the predicted diversity under linked selection does not fit the observed diversity–census-size relationship, implying that processes other than background selection and recurrent hitchhiking must be limiting diversity.},

            A great deal of empirical research speaks to the policy influence of one or another set of actors, but until recently it has not been possible to test these contrasting theoretical predictions against each other within a single statistical model. We report on an effort to do so, using a unique data set that includes measures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues.
            Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The results provide substantial support for theories of Economic-Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.},

	abstract = {Population genetics is a field of biology that studies the geneticcomposition of biological populations, and the changes in geneticcomposition that result from the operation of various factors,including natural selection. Population geneticists pursue their goalsby developing abstract mathematical models of gene frequency dynamics,trying to extract conclusions from those models about the likelypatterns of genetic variation in actual populations, and testing theconclusions against empirical data. A number of the more robustgeneralizations to emerge from population-genetic analysis arediscussed below., Population genetics is intimately bound up with the study of evolutionand natural selection, and is often regarded as the theoreticalcornerstone of modern Darwinism. This is because natural selection isone of the most important factors that can affect a population'sgenetic composition. Natural selection occurs when some variants in apopulation out-reproduce other variants as a result of being betteradapted to the environment, or ‘fitter’. Presuming thefitness differences are at least partly due to genetic differences,this will cause the population's genetic makeup to be altered overtime. By studying formal models of gene frequency change, populationgeneticists therefore hope to shed light on the evolutionary process,and to permit the consequences of different evolutionary hypotheses tobe explored in a quantitatively precise way., The field of population genetics came into being in the 1920s and1930s, thanks to the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and SewallWright. Their achievement was to integrate the principles of Mendeliangenetics, which had been rediscovered at the turn of century, withDarwinian natural selection. Though the compatibility of Darwinism withMendelian genetics is today taken for granted, in the early years ofthe twentieth century it was not. Many of the early Mendelians did notaccept Darwin's ‘gradualist’ account of evolution,believing instead that novel adaptations must arise in a singlemutational step; conversely, many of the early Darwinians did notbelieve in Mendelian inheritance, often because of the erroneous beliefthat it was incompatible with the process of evolutionary modificationas described by Darwin. By working out mathematically the consequencesof selection acting on a population obeying the Mendelian rules ofinheritance, Fisher, Haldane and Wright showed that Darwinism andMendelism were not just compatible but excellent bed fellows; thisplayed a key part in the formation of the ‘neo-Darwiniansynthesis’, and explains why population genetics came to occupyso pivotal a role in evolutionary theory., The discussion below is structured as follows. Section 1 outlines thehistory of population genetics, focusing on major themes. Section 2explains the Hardy-Weinberg principle, one of the most importantconcepts in population genetics. Section 3 introduces the reader tosimple population-genetic models of the evolutionary process, anddiscusses their significance. Section 4 discusses the status ofpopulation genetics in modern biology, and some criticisms that havebeen leveled against it. Section 5 examines some of the philosophicalissues raised by population genetics.},

It is still a challenge, however, to infer reliable parameter values for complicated models involving many populations. Here, we present MixMapper, an efﬁcient, interactive method for constructing phylogenetic trees including admixture events using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data. MixMapper implements a novel two-phase approach to admixture inference using moment statistics, ﬁrst building an unadmixed scaffold tree and then adding admixed populations by solving systems of equations that express allele frequency divergences in terms of mixture parameters. Importantly, all features of the model, including topology, sources of gene ﬂow, branch lengths, and mixture proportions, are optimized automatically from the data and include estimates of statistical uncertainty. MixMapper also uses a new method to express branch lengths in easily interpretable drift units. We apply MixMapper to recently published data for Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel individuals genotyped on a SNP array designed especially for use in population genetics studies, obtaining conﬁdent results for 30 populations, 20 of them admixed. Notably, we conﬁrm a signal of ancient admixture in European populations—including previously undetected admixture in Sardinians and Basques—involving a proportion of 20–40\% ancient northern Eurasian ancestry.},

	title = {Estimating {FST} and kinship for arbitrary population structures},
	abstract = {FST and kinship are key parameters often estimated in modern population genetics studies in order to quantitatively characterize structure and relatedness. Kinship matrices have also become a fundamental quantity used in genome-wide association studies and heritability estimation. The most frequently-used estimators of FST and kinship are method-of-moments estimators whose accuracies depend strongly on the existence of simple underlying forms of structure, such as the independent subpopulations model of non-overlapping, independently evolving subpopulations. However, modern data sets have revealed that these simple models of structure likely do not hold in many populations, including humans. In this work, we analyze the behavior of these estimators in the presence of arbitrarily-complex population structures, which results in an improved estimation framework specifically designed for arbitrary population structures. After generalizing the definition of FST to arbitrary population structures and establishing a framework for assessing bias and consistency of genome-wide estimators, we calculate the accuracy of existing FST and kinship estimators under arbitrary population structures, characterizing biases and estimation challenges unobserved under their originally-assumed models of structure. We then present our new approach, which consistently estimates kinship and FST when the minimum kinship value in the dataset is estimated consistently. We illustrate our results using simulated genotypes from an admixture model, constructing a one-dimensional geographic scenario that departs nontrivially from the independent subpopulations model. Our simulations reveal the potential for severe biases in estimates of existing approaches that are overcome by our new framework. This work may significantly improve future analyses that rely on accurate kinship and FST estimates.},

	abstract = {Rice stripe virus (RSV) has become a major pathogen of rice. To determine how the rice transcriptome is modified in response to RSV infection, we used RNA-Seq to perform a genome-wide gene expression analysis of a susceptible rice cultivar. The transcriptomes of RSV-infected samples were compared to those of mock-treated samples at 3, 7, and 15 days post-infection (dpi). From 8 to 11\% of the genes were differentially expressed ({\textgreater}2-fold difference in expression) in RSV-infected vs. noninfected rice. Among them, 532 genes were differentially expressed at all three time points. Surprisingly, 37.6\% of the 532 genes are related to transposons. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that many chloroplast genes were down-regulated in infected plants at 3 and 15 dpi. Expression of genes associated with cell differentiation and flowering was significantly down-regulated in infected plants at 15 dpi. In contrast, most of the up-regulated genes in infected plants concern the cell wall, plasma membrane, and vacuole and are known to function in various metabolic pathways and stress responses. In addition, transcripts of diverse transcription factors gradually accumulated in infected plants with increasing infection time. We also confirmed that the expression of gene subsets (including NBS-LRR domain-containing genes, receptor-like kinase genes, and genes involving RNA silencing) was changed by RSV infection. Taken together, we demonstrated that down-regulation of genes related to photosynthesis and flowering was strongly associated with disease symptoms caused by RSV and that up-regulation of genes involved in metabolic pathways, stress responses, and transcription was related to host defense mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed thousands of robust and replicable genetic associations for complex disease. However, the identiﬁcation of the causal variants that underlie these associations has been more difﬁcult. This problem of ﬁne-mapping association signals predates GWAS, but the last few years have seen a surge of studies aimed at pinpointing causal variants using both statistical evidence from large association data sets and functional annotations of genetic variants. Combining these two approaches can often determine not only the causal variant but also the target gene. Recent contributions include analyses of custom genotyping arrays, such as the Immunochip, statistical methods to identify credible sets of causal variants and the addition of functional genomic annotations for coding and non-coding variation to help prioritize variants and discern functional consequence and hence the biological basis of disease risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a widely used strategy for gene expression data analysis based on pathway knowledge. GSA focuses on sets of related genes and has established major advantages over individual gene analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological relevance. However, previous GSA methods have limited usage as they cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental designs.
Results: To address these limitations, we present a new GSA method called Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE). We successfully apply GAGE to multiple microarray datasets with different sample sizes, experimental designs and profiling techniques. GAGE shows significantly better results when compared to two other commonly used GSA methods of GSEA and PAGE. We demonstrate this improvement in the following three aspects: (1) consistency across repeated studies/experiments; (2) sensitivity and specificity; (3) biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms inferred. GAGE reveals novel and relevant regulatory mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished microarray studies. From two published lung cancer data sets, GAGE derived a more cohesive and predictive mechanistic scheme underlying lung cancer progress and metastasis. For a previously unpublished BMP6 study, GAGE predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for BMP6 induced osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical BMP-TGF beta signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathways–all of which are supported by the experimental literature.
Conclusion: GAGE is generally applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes and experimental designs. GAGE consistently outperformed two most frequently used GSA methods and inferred statistically and biologically more relevant regulatory pathways. The GAGE method is implemented in R in the "gage" package, available under the GNU GPL from http:// sysbio.engin.umich.edu/{\textasciitilde}luow/downloads.php.},

NGS short reads are often insufficient to create large contigs that span repeat sequences and to facilitate unambiguous assembly. Plant genomes are notorious for containing high quantities of repetitive elements, which combined with huge genome sizes, makes accurate assembly of these large and complex genomes intractable thus far. Using two-color genome mapping of tiling bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) clones on nanochannel arrays, we completed high-confidence assembly of a 2.1-Mb, highly repetitive region in the large and complex genome of Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). Genome mapping is based on direct visualization of sequence motifs on single DNA molecules hundreds of kilobases in length. With the genome map as a scaffold, we anchored unplaced sequence contigs, validated the initial draft assembly, and resolved instances of misassembly, some involving contigs ,2 kb long, to dramatically improve the assembly from 75\% to 95\% complete.},

	abstract = {Bovine leukosis (BL) is a retroviral disease caused by the bovine leukosis virus that affects only cattle. It is associated with decreased milk production and increased cull rates due to development of lymphosarcoma. The virus also affects the immune system. Infected cows display a weak response to some vaccinations. It is important to determine if the heritability of BL susceptibility is greater than zero, or if the environment is the only factor that can be used to reduce the transmission and incidence of the disease. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to estimate the heritability for BL incidence and the genetic merit of sires for leukosis resistance in Holstein and Jersey cattle. Continuous scores and binary milk ELISA results for 13,217 Holstein cows from 114 dairy herds across 16 states and 642 Jersey cows from 8 dairy herds were considered. Data were obtained from commercial testing records at Antel BioSystems (Lansing, MI). Out of the 13,859 animals tested, 38\% were found to be infected with the disease. Linear and threshold animal models were used to analyze the continuous and binary data, respectively. Results from both models were similar in terms of estimated breeding values and variance components in their respective scales. Estimates of heritability obtained with the 2 approaches were approximately 8\% for both breeds, indicating a considerable genetic component underlying BL disease incidence. The correlation between the estimated breeding values from the 2 models was larger than 0.90, and the lists of top 10\% bulls selected from each model had about 80\% overlap for both breeds. In summary, results indicate that a simple linear model using the continuous ELISA scores as the response variable was a reasonable approach for the genetic analysis of BL incidence in cattle. In addition, the levels of heritability found indicate that genetic selection could also be used to decrease susceptibility to bovine leukosis virus infection in Holstein and Jersey cattle.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing demand for evolutionary models to incorporate relatively realistic dynamics, ranging from selection at many genomic sites to complex demography, population structure, and ecological interactions. Such models can generally be implemented as individual‐based forward simulations, but the large computational overhead of these models often makes simulation of whole chromosome sequences in large populations infeasible. This situation presents an important obstacle to the field that requires conceptual advances to overcome. The recently developed treesequence recording method (Kelleher, Thornton, Ashander, \& Ralph, 2018), which stores the genealogical history of all genomes in the simulated population, could provide such an advance. This method has several benefits: (1) it allows neutral mutations to be omitted entirely from forward‐time simulations and added later, thereby dramatically improving computational efficiency; (2) it allows neutral burn‐in to be constructed extremely efficiently after the fact, using “recapitation”; (3) it allows direct examination and analysis of the genealogical trees along the genome; and (4) it provides a compact representation of a population’s genealogy that can be analysed in Python using the msprime package. We have implemented the tree‐sequence recording method in SLiM 3 (a free, open‐source evolutionary simulation software package) and extended it to allow the recording of non‐neutral mutations, greatly broadening the utility of this method. To demonstrate the versatility and performance of this approach, we showcase several practical applications that would have been beyond the reach of previously existing methods, opening up new horizons for the modelling and exploration of evolutionary processes.},

An approximate expression is derived for the distribution of coalescence times for a pair of sequences sampled from speciﬁc locations in a rectangular habitat. Results are qualitatively similar to previous analyses of isolation by distance, but account explicitly for the location of samples relative to the habitat boundaries. A separation-of-timescales approach takes advantage of the fact that the sampling locations affect only the recent coalescent behavior. When the population size is larger than the number of generations required for a lineage to cross the habitat range, the long-term genealogical process is reasonably well described by Kingman’s coalescent with time rescaled by the effective population size. This long-term effective population size is affected by the local dispersal behavior as well as the geometry of the habitat. When the population size is smaller than the time required to cross the habitat, deep branches in the genealogy are longer than would be expected under the standard neutral coalescent, similar to the pattern expected for a panmictic population whose population size was larger in the past.},

	abstract = {In the last 10 years a statistical technique, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), has been developed that can be used to infer parameters and choose between models in the complicated scenarios that are often considered in the environmental sciences. For example, based on gene sequence and microsatellite data, the method has been used to choose between competing models of human demographic history, and to infer growth rates, times of divergence and other parameters. The method ﬁts naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared. Although the method arose in population genetics, ABC has become increasingly used in other ﬁelds, including epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modelling, and many of these applications are brieﬂy described.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new, hierarchical, model for single-nucleotide polymorphism allele frequencies in a structured population, which is naturally ﬁtted via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. There is one parameter for each population, closely analogous to a populationspecific version of Wright’s FST , which can be interpreted as measuring how isolated the relevant population has been. Our model includes the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphism ascertainment and is motivated by population genetics considerations, explicitly in the transient setting after divergence of populations, rather than as the equilibrium of a stochastic model, as is traditionally the case. For the sizes of data set that we consider the method provides good parameter estimates and considerably outperforms estimation methods analogous to those currently used in practice. We apply the method to one new and one existing human data set, each with rather different characteristics—the ﬁrst consisting of three rather close European populations; the second of four populations taken from across the globe. A novelty of our framework is that the ﬁt of the underlying model can be assessed easily, and these results are encouraging for both data sets analysed. Our analysis suggests that Iceland is more differentiated than the other two European populations (France and Utah), a ﬁnding which is consistent with the historical record, but not obvious from comparisons of simple summary statistics.},

The SLiM forward genetic simulation framework is one of the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However, its foundation in the Wright–Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difﬁcult to adapt the Wright–Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, ﬁtness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce SLiM 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright–Fisher or “nonWF” model type provides a much more ﬂexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use.},

Another strategy based on a comparative virology approach is to characterize a related pathogen and to speculate on possible shared mechanisms.

Analyses of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or applied theoretically unjustiﬁed distance metrics to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance distance is both more theoretically justiﬁed and more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species’ range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The IBR model thus provides a ﬂexible and efﬁcient tool to account for habitat heterogeneity in studies of isolation by distance, improve understanding of how landscape characteristics affect genetic structuring, and predict genetic and evolutionary consequences of landscape change.},

We formulate variant calling as a hypothesis testing problem and employ a binomial–binomial model to test the significance of observed allele frequency against sequencing error. SNVer reports one single overall P-value for evaluating the significance of a candidate locus being a variant based on which multiplicity control can be obtained. This is particularly desirable because tens of thousands loci are simultaneously examined in typical NGS experiments. Each user can choose the false-positive error rate threshold he or she considers appropriate, instead of just the dichotomous decisions of whether to ‘accept or reject the candidates’ provided by most existing methods. We use both simulated data and real data to demonstrate the superior performance of our program in comparison with existing methods. SNVer runs very fast and can complete testing 300 K loci within an hour. This excellent scalability makes it feasible for analysis of whole-exome sequencing data, or even wholegenome sequencing data using high performance computing cluster.

	abstract = {The study of cell-population heterogeneity in a range of biological systems, from viruses to bacterial isolates to tumor samples, has been transformed by recent advances in sequencing throughput. While the high-coverage afforded can be used, in principle, to identify very rare variants in a population, existing ad hoc approaches frequently fail to distinguish true variants from sequencing errors. We report a method (LoFreq) that models sequencing run-specific error rates to accurately call variants occurring in {\textless}0.05\% of a population. Using simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that LoFreq has near-perfect specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared with existing methods and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing datasets without resorting to approximations or heuristics. We also present experimental validation for LoFreq on two different platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom) and its application to call rare somatic variants from exome sequencing datasets for gastric cancer.

	abstract = {Comprehensive disease gene discovery in both common and rare diseases will require the eﬃcient and accurate detection of all classes of genetic variation across tens to hundreds of thousands of human samples. We describe here a novel assembly-based approach to variant calling, the GATK HaplotypeCaller (HC) and Reference Conﬁdence Model (RCM), that determines genotype likelihoods independently per-sample but performs joint calling across all samples within a project simultaneously. We show by calling over 90,000 samples from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) that, in contrast to other algorithms, the HC-RCM scales eﬃciently to very large sample sizes without loss in accuracy; and that the accuracy of indel variant calling is superior in comparison to other algorithms. More importantly, the HC-RCM produces a fully squared-oﬀ matrix of genotypes across all samples at every genomic position being investigated. The HCRCM is a novel, scalable, assembly-based algorithm with abundant applications for population genetics and clinical studies.},

	abstract = {SAR11 is a group of small, carbon-oxidizing cells that reach a global estimated population size of 2.4 × 1028 cells—approximately 25\% of all plankton. They are found throughout the oceans but reach their largest numbers in stratiﬁed, oligotrophic gyres, which are an expanding habitat in the warming oceans. SAR11 likely had a Precambrian origin and, over geological time, evolved into the niche of harvesting labile, low-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (DOM). SAR11 cells are minimal in size and complexity, a phenomenon known as streamlining that is thought to beneﬁt them by lowering the material costs of replication and maximizing transport functions that are essential to competition at ultralow nutrient concentrations. One of the surprises in SAR11 metabolism is their ability to both oxidize and produce a variety of volatile organic compounds that can diffuse into the atmosphere. SAR11 cells divide slowly and lack many forms of regulation commonly used by bacterial cells to adjust to changing environmental conditions. As a result of genome reduction, they require an unusual range of nutrients, which leads to complex biochemical interactions with other plankton. The study of SAR11 is providing insight into the biogeochemistry of labile DOM and is affecting microbiology beyond marine science by providing a model for understanding the evolution and function of streamlined cells.},

	title = {The {GATK} joint genotyping workflow is appropriate for calling variants in {RNA}-seq experiments},
	abstract = {The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a popular set of programs for discovering and genotyping variants from next-generation sequencing data. The current GATK recommendation for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is to perform variant calling from individual samples, with the drawback that only variable positions are reported. Versions 3.0 and above of GATK offer the possibility of calling DNA variants on cohorts of samples using the HaplotypeCaller algorithm in Genomic Variant Call Format (GVCF) mode. Using this approach, variants are called individually on each sample, generating one GVCF file per sample that lists genotype likelihoods and their genome annotations. In a second step, variants are called from the GVCF files through a joint genotyping analysis. This strategy is more flexible and reduces computational challenges in comparison to the traditional joint discovery workflow. Using a GVCF workflow for mining SNP in RNA-seq data provides substantial advantages, including reporting homozygous genotypes for the reference allele as well as missing data. Taking advantage of RNA-seq data derived from primary macrophages isolated from 50 cows, the GATK joint genotyping method for calling variants on RNA-seq data was validated by comparing this approach to a so-called “per-sample” method. In addition, pair-wise comparisons of the two methods were performed to evaluate their respective sensitivity, precision and accuracy using DNA genotypes from a companion study including the same 50 cows genotyped using either genotyping-by-sequencing or with the Bovine SNP50 Beadchip (imputed to the Bovine high density). Results indicate that both approaches are very close in their capacity of detecting reference variants and that the joint genotyping method is more sensitive than the per-sample method. Given that the joint genotyping method is more flexible and technically easier, we recommend this approach for variant calling in RNA-seq experiments.},

We identify numerous cis-eQTLs that contribute to the marked differences in immune responses detected within and between populations and a strong trans-eQTL hotspot at TLR1 that decreases expression of pro-inﬂammatory genes in Europeans only. We ﬁnd that immune-responsive regulatory variants are enriched in population-speciﬁc signals of natural selection and show that admixture with Neandertals introduced regulatory variants into European genomes, affecting preferentially responses to viral challenges. Together, our study uncovers evolutionarily important determinants of differences in host immune responsiveness between human populations.},

So far, 84 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2.5 million small insertion deletions have been identified in the collection, a very high level of genetic diversity. The project has greatly accelerated the identification of deleterious mutations for a range of genetic diseases, as well as for embryonic lethals. The rate of identification of causal mutations for complex traits has been slower, reflecting the typically small effect size of these mutations and the fact that many are likely in as-yet-unannotated regulatory regions. Both the deleterious mutations that have been identified and the mutations associated with complex trait variation have been included in low-cost SNP array designs, and these arrays are being genotyped in tens of thousands of dairy and beef cattle animals, enabling management of deleterious mutations in these populations as well as genomic selection.},

In this paper, we evaluate the robustness and uniqueness of enrichment results as a means of assessing methods even where correctness is unknown. We show that heavily annotated (‘multifunctional’) genes are likely to appear in genomics study results and drive the generation of biologically non-speciﬁc enrichment results as well as highly fragile signiﬁcances. By providing a means of determining where enrichment analyses report non-speciﬁc and non-robust ﬁndings, we are able to assess where we can be conﬁdent in their use. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant progress in recent bias correction methods for enrichment and provide our own software implementation. Our approach can be readily adapted to any pre-existing package.},

	abstract = {A quantitative theory of directional mutation pressure proposed in 1962 explained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different bacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined parameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants were discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all organisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers plausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine content among different parts of the vertebrate genome.},

	abstract = {PCA is frequently used to discover and display patterns in SNP data from humans, animals, plants, and microbes—and especially to elucidate population structure. Given the popularity of PCA, one might expect that PCA is understood well and applied effectively. However, a survey of 125 representative articles from the literature reveals five departures from best practices. First, PCA works best with SNP coding 1 for the rare allele and 0 for the common allele, but many articles use some other coding. Second, we determined that double-centered PCA is the best variant of PCA for SNP data, but not a single article specified this choice. Third, SNP coding and PCA variant affect the quality and interpretation of PCA results, yet contrary to contemporary standards in science for transparency and reproducibility, few articles report these choices. Fourth, PCA biplots of both SNPs and Items (such as persons or cultivars) are more informative than PCA graphs of only Items, but not a single article presented a biplot. Fifth, PCA graphs and biplots should use the same scale for all axes, but only 10\% of the articles used correct scaling. The recommended best practices for PCA of SNP data are easily implemented and may yield new insights, especially about causality. The lessons learned here for PCA analysis of SNP data have implications for other statistical analyses and other kinds of genomics data.},

	abstract = {Background: RNA-seq has been a boon to the quantitative analysis of transcriptomes. A notable application is the detection of changes in transcript usage between experimental conditions. For example, discovery of pathological alternative splicing may allow the development of new treatments or better management of patients. From an analysis perspective, there are several ways to approach RNA-seq data to unravel differential transcript usage, such as annotation-based exon-level counting, differential analysis of the percentage spliced in, or quantitative analysis of assembled transcripts. The goal of this research is to compare and contrast current state-of-the-art methods, and to suggest improvements to commonly used work flows.
Results: We assess the performance of representative work flows using synthetic data and explore the effect of using non-standard counting bin definitions as input to DEXSeq, a state-of-the-art inference engine. Although the canonical counting provided the best results overall, several non-canonical approaches were as good or better in specific aspects and most counting approaches outperformed the evaluated event- and assembly-based methods. We show that an incomplete annotation catalog can have a detrimental effect on the ability to detect differential transcript usage in transcriptomes with few isoforms per gene and that isoform-level prefiltering can considerably improve false discovery rate control.
Conclusion: Count-based methods generally perform well in the detection of differential transcript usage. Controlling the false discovery rate at the imposed threshold is difficult, particularly in complex organisms, but can be improved by prefiltering the annotation catalog.},

However, the proﬁling of nascent transcripts, which often include nonpolyadenylated RNAs, can unveil novel insights into transcriptional regulation. Here, we separately sequenced total RNAs (Total RNAseq) and mRNAs (mRNAseq) from the same HIV-1-infected human CD4؉ T cells. We found that many nonpolyadenylated RNAs were differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection, and we identiﬁed 8 times more differentially expressed genes at 12 h postinfection by Total RNAseq than by mRNAseq. These expression changes were also evident by concurrent changes in introns and were recapitulated by later mRNA changes, revealing an unexpectedly signiﬁcant delay between transcriptional initiation and mature mRNA production early after HIV-1 infection. We computationally derived and validated the underlying regulatory programs, and we predicted drugs capable of reversing these HIV-1-induced expression changes followed by experimental conﬁrmation. Our results show that combined total and mRNA transcriptome analysis is essential for fully capturing the early host response to virus infection and provide a framework for identifying candidate drugs for host-directed therapy against HIV/AIDS.},

Many highly convergent adaptations are also complex, which makes their repeated emergence surprising. In plants, the evolutionary history of two carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) — C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis — presents such a paradox. Both of these modifications of ancestral C3 photosynthesis require the integration of multiple anatomical and biochemical components, yet together they have evolved more than one hundred times. The presence of CCM enzymes in all plants suggests that a rudimentary CCM might emerge via relatively few genetic changes in potentiated lineages. Here, we propose that many of the complexities often associated with C4 and CAM photosynthesis may have evolved during a post-emergence optimization phase. The ongoing development of new model clades for young, emerging CCMs is enabling the comparative studies needed to test these ideas.},

              standard approach for transcriptome analysis with ever-reducing cost. It has considerable advantages over conventional technologies (microarrays) because it allows for direct identification and quantification of transcripts. Many time series RNA-seq datasets have been collected to study the dynamic regulations of transcripts. However, statistically rigorous and computationally efficient methods are needed to explore the time-dependent changes of gene expression in biological systems. These methods should explicitly account for the dependencies of expression patterns across time points. Here, we discuss several methods that can be applied to model timecourse RNA-seq data, including statistical evolutionary trajectory index (SETI), autoregressive time-lagged regression (AR(1)), and hidden Markov model (HMM) approaches. We use three real datasets and simulation studies to demonstrate the utility of these dynamic methods in temporal analysis.},

However, accurate quantification of expression at the transcript level is limited with current RNA-seq technologies because of, for example, limited read length and the cost of deep sequencing.
Results: A large number of tools have been developed to tackle this problem, and we performed a comprehensive evaluation of these tools using both experimental and simulated RNA-seq datasets. We found that recently developed alignment-free tools are both fast and accurate. The accuracy of all methods was mainly influenced by the complexity of gene structures and caution must be taken when interpreting quantification results for short transcripts. Using TP53 gene simulation, we discovered that both sequencing depth and the relative abundance of different isoforms affect quantification accuracy
Conclusions: Our comprehensive evaluation helps data analysts to make informed choice when selecting computational tools for isoform quantification.},

However, it is unclear whether these state-of-the-art RNA-seq analysis pipelines can quantify small RNAs as accurately as they do with long RNAs in the context of total RNA quantification.
Result: We comprehensively tested and compared four RNA-seq pipelines for accuracy of gene quantification and fold-change estimation. We used a novel total RNA benchmarking dataset in which small non-coding RNAs are highly represented along with other long RNAs. The four RNA-seq pipelines consisted of two commonly-used alignment-free pipelines and two variants of alignment-based pipelines. We found that all pipelines showed high accuracy for quantifying the expression of long and highly-abundant genes. However, alignment-free pipelines showed systematically poorer performance in quantifying lowly-abundant and small RNAs.
Conclusion: We have shown that alignment-free and traditional alignment-based quantification methods perform similarly for common gene targets, such as protein-coding genes. However, we have identified a potential pitfall in analyzing and quantifying lowly-expressed genes and small RNAs with alignment-free pipelines, especially when these small RNAs contain biological variations.},

	abstract = {Background: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression proﬁles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular proﬁling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and ﬂexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.
Results: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in diﬀerential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments.
Conclusions: GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data.

This paper reviews the life cycle analysis (LCA) approach to quantifying these emissions and argues that, given the dynamic complexity of our food system, it offers a limited understanding of livestock’s GHG impacts. It is argued that LCA’s conclusions need rather to be considered within a broader conceptual framework that incorporates three key additional perspectives. The ﬁrst is an understanding of the indirect second order effects of livestock production on land use change and associated CO2 emissions. The second compares the opportunity cost of using land and resources to rear animals with their use for other food or non-food purposes. The third perspective is need—the paper considers how far people need livestock products at all. These perspectives are used as lenses through which to explore both the impacts of livestock production and the mitigation approaches that are being proposed. The discussion is then broadened to consider whether it is possible to substantially reduce livestock emissions through technological measures alone, or whether reductions in livestock consumption will additionally be required. The paper argues for policy strategies that explicitly combine GHG mitigation with measures to improve food security and concludes with suggestions for further research.},

	abstract = {An integral part of functional genomics studies is to assess the enrichment of speciﬁc biological terms in lists of genes found to be playing an important role in biological phenomena. Contrasting the observed frequency of annotated terms with those of the background is at the core of overrepresentation analysis (ORA). Gene Ontology (GO) is a means to consistently classify and annotate gene products and has become a mainstay in ORA. Alternatively, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) offers a comprehensive life science vocabulary including additional categories that are not covered by GO. Although MeSH is applied predominantly in human and model organism research, its full potential in livestock genetics is yet to be explored. In this study, MeSH ORA was evaluated to discern biological properties of identiﬁed genes and contrast them with the results obtained from GO enrichment analysis. Three published datasets were employed for this purpose, representing a gene expression study in dairy cattle, the use of SNPs for genome-wide prediction in swine and the identiﬁcation of genomic regions targeted by selection in horses. We found that several overrepresented MeSH annotations linked to these gene sets share similar concepts with those of GO terms. Moreover, MeSH yielded unique annotations, which are not directly provided by GO terms, suggesting that MeSH has the potential to reﬁne and enrich the representation of biological knowledge. We demonstrated that MeSH can be regarded as another choice of annotation to draw biological inferences from genes identiﬁed via experimental analyses. When used in combination with GO terms, our results indicate that MeSH can enhance our functional interpretations for speciﬁc biological conditions or the genetic basis of complex traits in livestock species.},

	abstract = {Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been applied as important molecular markers in genetics and breeding studies. The rapid advance of next generation sequencing (NGS) provides a high-throughput means of SNP discovery. However, SNP development is limited by the availability of reliable SNP discovery methods. Especially, the optimum assembler and SNP caller for accurate SNP prediction from next generation sequencing data are not known.
Results: Herein we performed SNP prediction based on RNA-seq data of peach and mandarin peel tissue under a comprehensive comparison of two paired-end read lengths (125 bp and 150 bp), five assemblers (Trinity, IDBA, oases, SOAPdenovo, Trans-abyss) and two SNP callers (GATK and GBS). The predicted SNPs were compared with the authentic SNPs identified via PCR amplification followed by gene cloning and sequencing procedures. A total of 40 and 240 authentic SNPs were presented in five anthocyanin biosynthesis related genes in peach and in nine carotenogenic genes in mandarin. Putative SNPs predicted from the same RNA-seq data with different strategies led to quite divergent results. The rate of false positive SNPs was significantly lower when the paired-end read length was 150 bp compared with 125 bp. Trinity was superior to the other four assemblers and GATK was substantially superior to GBS due to a low rate of missing authentic SNPs. The combination of assembler Trinity, SNP caller GATK, and the paired-end read length 150 bp had the best performance in SNP discovery with 100\% accuracy both in peach and in mandarin cases. This strategy was applied to the characterization of SNPs in peach and mandarin transcriptomes.
Conclusions: Through comparison of authentic SNPs obtained by PCR cloning strategy and putative SNPs predicted from different combinations of five assemblers, two SNP callers, and two paired-end read lengths, we provided a reliable and efficient strategy, Trinity-GATK with 150 bp paired-end read length, for SNP discovery from RNA-seq data. This strategy discovered SNP at 100\% accuracy in peach and mandarin cases and might be applicable to a wide range of plants and other organisms.},

	abstract = {Background: High throughput sequencing technology provides us unprecedented opportunities to study transcriptome dynamics. Compared to microarray-based gene expression profiling, RNA-Seq has many advantages, such as high resolution, low background, and ability to identify novel transcripts. Moreover, for genes with multiple isoforms, expression of each isoform may be estimated from RNA-Seq data. Despite these advantages, recent work revealed that base level read counts from RNA-Seq data may not be randomly distributed and can be affected by local nucleotide composition. It was not clear though how the base level read count bias may affect gene level expression estimates.
Results: In this paper, by using five published RNA-Seq data sets from different biological sources and with different data preprocessing schemes, we showed that commonly used estimates of gene expression levels from RNA-Seq data, such as reads per kilobase of gene length per million reads (RPKM), are biased in terms of gene length, GC content and dinucleotide frequencies. We directly examined the biases at the gene-level, and proposed a simple generalized-additive-model based approach to correct different sources of biases simultaneously. Compared to previously proposed base level correction methods, our method reduces bias in gene-level expression estimates more effectively.
Conclusions: Our method identifies and corrects different sources of biases in gene-level expression measures from RNA-Seq data, and provides more accurate estimates of gene expression levels from RNA-Seq. This method should prove useful in meta-analysis of gene expression levels using different platforms or experimental protocols.},

	abstract = {Many aspects of the historical relationships between populations in a species are reflected in genetic data. Inferring these relationships from genetic data, however, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a statistical model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple populations. In our model, the sampled populations in a species are related to their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of 55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example, in the human data, we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16\% of their ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable fraction of their ancestry (9\% and 25\%, respectively) to wolves subsequent to domestication and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese) result from admixture between modern toy breeds and ‘‘ancient’’ Asian breeds.

Quantitative genetics is now reaching beyond disease associations as statistical constructs, toward real biological understanding. On the other hand, molecular biology has a lot to gain in understanding the range of population variation in genome function and using genetic effects as a causality anchor in cellular networks and disease etiology. The GWAS community has been exemplary in establishing commonly accepted gold standards for statistical analysis.

The evolutionary genetic dissection of the immune system has greatly helped to distinguish genes and functions that are essential, redundant or advantageous for human survival. It is also becoming increasingly clear that admixture between early Eurasians with now-extinct hominins such as Neanderthals or Denisovans, or admixture between modern human populations, can be beneficial for human adaptation to pathogen pressures. In this review, we discuss how the integration of population genetics with functional genomics in diverse human populations can inform about the changes in immune functions related to major lifestyle transitions (e.g., from hunting and gathering to farming), the action of natural selection to the evolution of the immune system, and the history of past epidemics. We also highlight the need of expanding the characterization of the immune system to a larger array of human populations—particularly neglected human groups historically exposed to different pathogen pressures—to fully capture the relative contribution of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors to immune response variation in humans.},

	abstract = {The detection of molecular signatures of selection is one of the major concerns of modern population genetics. A widely used strategy in this context is to compare samples from several populations and to look for genomic regions with outstanding genetic differentiation between these populations. Genetic differentiation is generally based on allele frequency differences between populations, which are measured by FST or related statistics. Here we introduce a new statistic, denoted hapFLK, which focuses instead on the differences of haplotype frequencies between populations. In contrast to most existing statistics, hapFLK accounts for the hierarchical structure of the sampled populations. Using computer simulations, we show that each of these two features—the use of haplotype information and of the hierarchical structure of populations—signiﬁcantly improves the detection power of selected loci and that combining them in the hapFLK statistic provides even greater power. We also show that hapFLK is robust with respect to bottlenecks and migration and improves over existing approaches in many situations. Finally, we apply hapFLK to a set of six sheep breeds from Northern Europe and identify seven regions under selection, which include already reported regions but also several new ones. We propose a method to help identifying the population(s) under selection in a detected region, which reveals that in many of these regions selection most likely occurred in more than one population. Furthermore, several of the detected regions correspond to incomplete sweeps, where the favorable haplotype is only at intermediate frequency in the population(s) under selection.},

	title = {Computational {Complexity} as an {Ultimate} {Constraint} on {Evolution}},
	abstract = {Experiments show that evolutionary ﬁtness landscapes can have a rich combinatorial structure due to epistasis. For some landscapes, this structure can produce a computational constraint that prevents evolution from ﬁnding local ﬁtness optima – thus overturning the traditional assumption that local ﬁtness peaks can always be reached quickly if no other evolutionary forces challenge natural selection. Here, I introduce a distinction between easy landscapes of traditional theory where local ﬁtness peaks can be found in a moderate number of steps and hard landscapes where ﬁnding local optima requires an infeasible amount of time. Hard examples exist even among landscapes with no reciprocal sign epistasis; on these semi-smooth ﬁtness landscapes, strong selection weak mutation dynamics cannot ﬁnd the unique peak in polynomial time. More generally, on hard rugged ﬁtness landscapes that include reciprocal sign epistasis, no evolutionary dynamics – even ones that do not follow adaptive paths – can ﬁnd a local ﬁtness optimum quickly. Moreover, on hard landscapes, the ﬁtness advantage of nearby mutants cannot drop off exponentially fast but has to follow a power-law that long term evolution experiments have associated with unbounded growth in ﬁtness. Thus, the constraint of computational complexity enables open-ended evolution on ﬁnite landscapes. Knowing this constraint allows us to use the tools of theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization to characterize the ﬁtness landscapes that we expect to see in nature. I present candidates for hard landscapes at scales from single genes, to microbes, to complex organisms with costly learning (Baldwin effect) or maintained cooperation (Hankshaw effect). Just how ubiquitous hard landscapes (and the corresponding ultimate constraint on evolution) are in nature becomes an open empirical question.},

Thus, there is considerable interest in quantifying the strength of selection. A full likelihood approach for inference about selection at a single site within an otherwise neutral fully linked sequence of sites is described here. A coalescent model of evolution is used to model the ancestry of a sample of DNA sequences which have the selected site segregating. The mutation model, for the selected and neutral sites, is the inﬁnitely many-sites model where there is no back or parallel mutation at sites. A unique perfect phylogeny, a gene tree, can be constructed from the conﬁguration of mutations on the sample sequences under this model of mutation. The approach is general and can be used for any bi-allelic selection scheme. Selection is incorporated through modelling the frequency of the selected and neutral allelic classes stochastically back in time, then using a subdivided population model considering the population frequencies through time as variable population sizes. An importance sampling algorithm is then used to explore over coalescent tree space consistent with the data. The method is applied to a simulated data set and the gene tree presented in Verrelli et al. (2002). r 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Results: We have assembled the 35 million sequence reads and applied a variety of assembly improvement techniques, creating an assembly of 2.86 billion base pairs that has multiple improvements over previous assemblies: it is more complete, covering more of the genome; thousands of gaps have been closed; many erroneous inversions, deletions, and translocations have been corrected; and thousands of single-nucleotide errors have been corrected. Our evaluation using independent metrics demonstrates that the resulting assembly is substantially more accurate and complete than alternative versions.
Conclusions: By using independent mapping data and conserved synteny between the cow and human genomes, we were able to construct an assembly with excellent large-scale contiguity in which a large majority (approximately 91\%) of the genome has been placed onto the 30 B. taurus chromosomes. We constructed a new cow-human synteny map that expands upon previous maps. We also identified for the first time a portion of the B. taurus Y chromosome.},

	abstract = {Adaptation in response to selection on polygenic phenotypes may occur via subtle allele frequencies shifts at many loci. Current population genomic techniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine this knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify traits that may have been influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact that GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to estimate the mean additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We use a general model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of populations with an arbitrary relatedness structure. Based on this model, we develop methods for detecting unusually strong correlations between genetic values and specific environmental variables, as well as a generalization of QST =FST comparisons to test for over-dispersion of genetic values among populations. Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual populations or groups of populations that contribute to the signal of overdispersion. These tests have considerably greater power than their single locus equivalents due to the fact that they look for positive covariance between like effect alleles, and also significantly outperform methods that do not account for population structure. We apply our tests to the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) dataset using GWAS data for height, skin pigmentation, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and two inflammatory bowel disease datasets. This analysis uncovers a number of putative signals of local adaptation, and we discuss the biological interpretation and caveats of these results.},

	abstract = {The diversity of populations in domestic species offers great opportunities to study genome response to selection. The recently published Sheep HapMap dataset is a great example of characterization of the world wide genetic diversity in sheep. In this study, we re-analyzed the Sheep HapMap dataset to identify selection signatures in worldwide sheep populations. Compared to previous analyses, we made use of statistical methods that (i) take account of the hierarchical structure of sheep populations, (ii) make use of linkage disequilibrium information and (iii) focus specifically on either recent or older selection signatures. We show that this allows pinpointing several new selection signatures in the sheep genome and distinguishing those related to modern breeding objectives and to earlier post-domestication constraints. The newly identified regions, together with the ones previously identified, reveal the extensive genome response to selection on morphology, color and adaptation to new environments.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-10-22},
	abstract = {Background: Biologists need to perform complex queries, often across a variety of databases. Typically, each data resource provides an advanced query interface, each of which must be learnt by the biologist before they can begin to query them. Frequently, more than one data source is required and for high-throughput analysis, cutting and pasting results between websites is certainly very time consuming. Therefore, many groups rely on local bioinformatics support to process queries by accessing the resource's programmatic interfaces if they exist. This is not an efficient solution in terms of cost and time. Instead, it would be better if the biologist only had to learn one generic interface. BioMart provides such a solution.
Results: BioMart enables scientists to perform advanced querying of biological data sources through a single web interface. The power of the system comes from integrated querying of data sources regardless of their geographical locations. Once these queries have been defined, they may be automated with its "scripting at the click of a button" functionality. BioMart's capabilities are extended by integration with several widely used software packages such as BioConductor, DAS, Galaxy, Cytoscape, Taverna. In this paper, we describe all aspects of BioMart from a user's perspective and demonstrate how it can be used to solve real biological use cases such as SNP selection for candidate gene screening or annotation of microarray results.
Conclusion: BioMart is an easy to use, generic and scalable system and therefore, has become an integral part of large data resources including Ensembl, UniProt, HapMap, Wormbase, Gramene, Dictybase, PRIDE, MSD and Reactome. BioMart is freely accessible to use at http:// www.biomart.org.},

Speciﬁcally, we use haplotype clusters identiﬁed with BEAGLE, which is a program implementing a hidden Markov model for localized haplotype clustering and performing several functions including inference of haplotype phase. We apply this methodology to HapMap phase 3 data. With this haplotypecluster approach, African populations have highest diversity and lowest divergence from the ancestral population, East Asian populations have lowest diversity and highest divergence, and other populations (European, Indian, and Mexican) have intermediate levels of diversity and divergence. These relationships accord with expectation based on other studies and accepted models of human history. In contrast, the population-speciﬁc FST estimates obtained directly from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not reﬂect such expected relationships. We show that ascertainment bias of SNPs has less impact on the proposed haplotype-cluster-based FST than on the SNP-based version, which provides a potential explanation for these results. Thus, these new measures of FST and haplotype-cluster diversity provide an important new tool for population genetic analysis of high-density SNP data.},

Here, we describe recombination landscape estimation using recurrent neural networks (ReLERNN), a deep learning method for estimating a genome-wide recombination map that is accurate even with small numbers of pooled or individually sequenced genomes. Rather than use summaries of linkage disequilibrium as its input, ReLERNN takes columns from a genotype alignment, which are then modeled as a sequence across the genome using a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that ReLERNN improves accuracy and reduces bias relative to existing methods and maintains high accuracy in the face of demographic model misspeciﬁcation, missing genotype calls, and genome inaccessibility. We apply ReLERNN to natural populations of African Drosophila melanogaster and show that genome-wide recombination landscapes, although largely correlated among populations, exhibit important population-speciﬁc differences. Lastly, we connect the inferred patterns of recombination with the frequencies of major inversions segregating in natural Drosophila populations.},

However, it is unknown whether this has a genetic basis. Using a comparative genomic study, we show that natural selection on genetic variants in the PDE10A gene have increased spleen size in the Bajau, providing them with a larger reservoir of oxygenated red blood cells. We also ﬁnd evidence of strong selection speciﬁc to the Bajau on BDKRB2, a gene affecting the human diving reﬂex.

In this study, we introduce LSD (levels of exclusively shared differences), a fast and ﬂexible framework to perform genome-wide selection scans, along the internal and external branches of a given population tree. We use forward simulations to demonstrate that LSD can identify branches targeted by positive selection with remarkable sensitivity and specificity. We illustrate a range of potential applications by analyzing data from the 1000 Genomes Project and uncover a list of adaptive candidates accompanying the expansion of anatomically modern humans out of Africa and their spread to Europe.},

In this paper, we present a new maximum likelihood method for ﬁnding regions under positive selection. The method is based on a Gaussian approximation to allele frequency changes and it incorporates admixture between populations. The method can analyze multiple populations simultaneously and retains power to detect selection signatures speciﬁc to ancestry components that are not representative of any extant populations. We evaluate the method using simulated data and compare it to related methods based on summary statistics. We also apply it to human genomic data and identify loci with extreme genetic diﬀerentiation between major geographic groups. Many of the genes identiﬁed are previously known selected loci relating to hair pigmentation and morphology, skin and eye pigmentation. We also identify new candidate regions, including various selected loci in the Native American component of admixed Mexican-Americans.

In this article, we review the three basic simulation frameworks—coalescent, forward, and resampling—and some of the existing simulators that fall under these frameworks, comparing them with respect to their evolutionary and demographic scenarios, their computational complexity, and their speciﬁc applications. Additionally, we address some limitations in current simulation algorithms and discuss future challenges in the development of more powerful simulation tools.},

	abstract = {Population structure is a confounding factor in genome-wide association studies, increasing the rate of false positive associations. To correct for it, several model-based algorithms such as ADMIXTURE and STRUCTURE have been proposed. These tend to suffer from the fact that they have a considerable computational burden, limiting their applicability when used with large datasets, such as those produced by next generation sequencing techniques. To address this, nonmodel based approaches such as sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (sNMF) and EIGENSTRAT have been proposed, which scale better with larger data. Here we present a novel nonmodel-based approach, population structure inference using kernel-PCA and optimization (PSIKO), which is based on a unique combination of linear kernel-PCA and least-squares optimization and allows for the inference of admixture coefﬁcients, principal components, and number of founder populations of a dataset. PSIKO has been compared against existing leading methods on a variety of simulation scenarios, as well as on real biological data. We found that in addition to producing results of the same quality as other tested methods, PSIKO scales extremely well with dataset size, being considerably (up to 30 times) faster for longer sequences than even state-of-the-art methods such as sNMF.

	abstract = {The dimension of the population genetics data produced by next-generation sequencing platforms is extremely high. However, the ‘‘intrinsic dimensionality’’ of sequence data, which determines the structure of populations, is much lower. This motivates us to use locally linear embedding (LLE) which projects high dimensional genomic data into low dimensional, neighborhood preserving embedding, as a general framework for population structure and historical inference. To facilitate application of the LLE to population genetic analysis, we systematically investigate several important properties of the LLE and reveal the connection between the LLE and principal component analysis (PCA). Identifying a set of markers and genomic regions which could be used for population structure analysis will provide invaluable information for population genetics and association studies. In addition to identifying the LLE-correlated or PCA-correlated structure informative marker, we have developed a new statistic that integrates genomic information content in a genomic region for collectively studying its association with the population structure and LASSO algorithm to search such regions across the genomes. We applied the developed methodologies to a low coverage pilot dataset in the 1000 Genomes Project and a PHASE III Mexico dataset of the HapMap. We observed that 25.1\%, 44.9\% and 21.4\% of the common variants and 89.2\%, 92.4\% and 75.1\% of the rare variants were the LLE-correlated markers in CEU, YRI and ASI, respectively. This showed that rare variants, which are often private to specific populations, have much higher power to identify population substructure than common variants. The preliminary results demonstrated that next generation sequencing offers a rich resources and LLE provide a powerful tool for population structure analysis.},

	abstract = {Comparisons of DNA from archaic and modern humans show that these groups interbred, and in some cases received an evolutionary advantage from doing so. This process—adaptive introgression—may lead to a faster rate of adaptation than is predicted from models with mutation and selection alone. Within the last couple of years, a series of studies have identiﬁed regions of the genome that are likely examples of adaptive introgression. In many cases, once a region was ascertained as being introgressed, commonly used statistics based on both haplotype as well as allele frequency information were employed to test for positive selection. Introgression by itself, however, changes both the haplotype structure and the distribution of allele frequencies, thus confounding traditional tests for detecting positive selection. Therefore, patterns generated by introgression alone may lead to false inferences of positive selection. Here we explore models involving both introgression and positive selection to investigate the behavior of various statistics under adaptive introgression. In particular, we ﬁnd that the number and allelic frequencies of sites that are uniquely shared between archaic humans and speciﬁc present-day populations are particularly useful for detecting adaptive introgression. We then examine the 1000 Genomes dataset to characterize the landscape of uniquely shared archaic alleles in human populations. Finally, we identify regions that were likely subject to adaptive introgression and discuss some of the most promising candidate genes located in these regions.},

	abstract = {An open question in human evolution is the importance of polygenic adaptation: adaptive changes in the mean of a multifactorial trait due to shifts in allele frequencies across many loci. In recent years, several methods have been developed to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful, these methods suffer from limited interpretability: they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this, we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical divergences and admixture events relating different populations through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer branch-speciﬁc parameters reﬂecting the strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally, we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that this method—which we call PolyGraph—has good power to detect polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic data from around the world. We also provide evidence that variants associated with several traits, including height, educational attainment, and self-reported unibrow, have been inﬂuenced by polygenic adaptation in different populations during human evolution.},

An area of particular interest is the interaction among population structure, natural selection, and genetic drift. At ﬁrst glance, different results in this area give very different impressions of the effect of population subdivision on effective population size (Ne), suggesting that no single value of Ne can completely characterize a structured population. Results presented here show that a population conforming to Wright’s island model of subdivision with genic selection can be related to an idealized panmictic population (a Wright-Fisher population). This equivalent panmictic population has a larger size than the actual population; i.e., Ne is larger than the actual population size, as expected from many results for this type of population structure. The selection coefﬁcient in the equivalent panmictic population, referred to here as the effective selection coefﬁcient (se), is smaller than the actual selection coefﬁcient (s ). This explains how the ﬁxation probability of a selected allele can be unaffected by population subdivision despite the fact that subdivision increases Ne, for the product Nese is not altered by subdivision.},

	abstract = {We consider a population subdivided into two demes connected by migration in which selection acts in opposite direction. We explore the effects of recombination and migration on the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism, on local adaptation, and on differentiation by employing a deterministic model with genic selection on two linked diallelic loci (i.e., no dominance or epistasis). For the following cases, we characterize explicitly the possible equilibrium conﬁgurations: weak, strong, highly asymmetric, and super-symmetric migration, no or weak recombination, and independent or strongly recombining loci. For independent loci (linkage equilibrium) and for completely linked loci, we derive the possible bifurcation patterns as functions of the total migration rate, assuming all other parameters are ﬁxed but arbitrary. For these and other cases, we determine analytically the maximum migration rate below which a stable fully polymorphic equilibrium exists. In this case, differentiation and local adaptation are maintained. Their degree is quantiﬁed by a new multilocus version of FST and by the migration load, respectively. In addition, we investigate the invasion conditions of locally beneﬁcial mutants and show that linkage to a locus that is already in migration-selection balance facilitates invasion. Hence, loci of much smaller effect can invade than predicted by one-locus theory if linkage is sufﬁciently tight. We study how this minimum amount of linkage admitting invasion depends on the migration pattern. This suggests the emergence of clusters of locally beneﬁcial mutations, which may form ‘genomic islands of divergence’. Finally, the inﬂuence of linkage and twoway migration on the effective migration rate at a linked neutral locus is explored. Numerical work complements our analytical results.},

But it is sometimes difﬁcult to decide which genetic distance should be used. In this paper we review the behaviour of the main distances encountered in the literature in various divergence models. In the ﬁrst part, we consider that breeds are populations in which the assumption of equilibrium between drift and mutation is veriﬁed. In this case some interesting distances can be expressed as a function of divergence time, t, and therefore can be used to construct phylogenies. Distances based on allele size distribution (such as (δµ)2 and derived distances), taking a mutation model of microsatellites, the Stepwise Mutation Model, speciﬁcally into account, exhibit large variance and therefore should not be used to accurately infer phylogeny of closely related breeds. In the last section, we will consider that breeds are small populations and that the divergence times between them are too small to consider that the observed diversity is due to mutations: divergence is mainly due to genetic drift. Expectation and variance of distances were calculated as a function of the Wright-Malécot inbreeding coefﬁcient, F. Computer simulations performed under this divergence model show that the Reynolds distance [57] is the best method for very closely related breeds.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population in forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary breeding models, population structure and demography. This approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly ‘simplify’ a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the extant population, we show that the total storage space required is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large, wholegenome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a simulation’s entire final generation as well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.},

Here, we report ∼2.3 million genotypes from 1,028 individuals representing 115 indigenous Philippine populations and genome-sequence data from two ∼8,000-y-old individuals from Liangdao in the Taiwan Strait. We show that the Philippine islands were populated by at least five waves of human migration: initially by Northern and Southern Negritos (distantly related to Australian and Papuan groups), followed by Manobo, Sama, Papuan, and Cordilleran-related populations. The ancestors of Cordillerans diverged from indigenous peoples of Taiwan at least ∼8,000 y ago, prior to the arrival of paddy field rice agriculture in the Philippines ∼2,500 y ago, where some of their descendants remain to be the least admixed East Asian groups carrying an ancestry shared by all Austronesian-speaking populations. These observations contradict an exclusive “out-of-Taiwan” model of farming–language–people dispersal within the last four millennia for the Philippines and Island Southeast Asia. Sama-related ethnic groups of southwestern Philippines additionally experienced some minimal South Asian gene flow starting ∼1,000 y ago. Lastly, only a few lowlanders, accounting for {\textless}1\% of all individuals, presented a low level of West Eurasian admixture, indicating a limited genetic legacy of Spanish colonization in the Philippines. Altogether, our findings reveal a multilayered history of the Philippines, which served as a crucial gateway for the movement of people that ultimately changed the genetic landscape of the Asia-Pacific region.},

	abstract = {The genetic diversity of humans, like many species, has been shaped by a complex pattern of population separations followed by isolation and subsequent admixture. This pattern, reaching at least as far back as the appearance of our species in the paleontological record, has left its traces in our genomes. Reconstructing a population’s history from these traces is a challenging problem. Here we present a novel approach based on the Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (MSMC) to analyze the separation history between populations. Our approach, called MSMC-IM, uses an improved implementation of the MSMC (MSMC2) to estimate coalescence rates within and across pairs of populations, and then fits a continuous Isolation-Migration model to these rates to obtain a time-dependent estimate of gene flow. We show, using simulations, that our method can identify complex demographic scenarios involving post-split admixture or archaic introgression. We apply MSMC-IM to whole genome sequences from 15 worldwide populations, tracking the process of human genetic diversification. We detect traces of extremely deep ancestry between some African populations, with around 1\% of ancestry dating to divergences older than a million years ago.},

	abstract = {The pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) method uses the genome sequence of a single individual to estimate demographic history covering a time span of thousands of generations. Although originally designed for whole-genome data, we here use simulations to investigate its applicability to reference genome-aligned restriction site associated DNA (RAD) data. We ﬁnd that RAD data can potentially be used for PSMC analysis, but at present with limitations. The key factor is the proportion (p) of the genome that the RAD data covers. In our simulations, a proportion of 10\% can still retain a substantial amount of coalescent information, whereas for 1\% estimation becomes unreliable. The performance depends strongly on mutation rate (l) and recombination rate (r) and is proportional to l*p/r. When the value of this term is low, increasing the amount of data and number of iterations helps restoring the power of the estimation. We subsequently analyse one whole-genome-sequenced and 17 RAD-sequenced threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from a lake in Greenland. The whole-genome sequence suggests a relatively recent expansion and decline within ca. 4000–40 000 generations ago, possibly reﬂecting postglacial expansion and founding of the lake population. RAD data, where chromosomes from 10 individuals are combined, identify a similar pattern. Our study provides guidance about the use of PSMC analysis and suggests measures that can improve its utility for RAD data. Finally, the study shows that RAD loci in general contain coalescent information that can be used for developing more targeted methods.},

However, using the model as the basis for inference is currently severely restricted by the computational challenge of estimating the likelihood. We discuss why the coalescent with recombination is so challenging to work with and explore whether simpler models, under which inference is more tractable, may prove useful for genealogy-based inference. We introduce a simplification of the coalescent process in which coalescence between lineages with no overlapping ancestral material is banned. The resulting process has a simple Markovian structure when generating genealogies sequentially along a sequence, yet has very similar properties to the full model, both in terms of describing patterns of genetic variation and as the basis for statistical inference.},

Using simulated data, we show that the performance of MAGIC is comparable to that of PSMC’ even on single diploid samples generated with standard coalescent and recombination models. Applying MAGIC to a sample of human genomes reveals evidence of non-demographic factors driving coalescence.},

This ancient history now influences human infectious disease susceptibility and microbiome homeostasis, and contributes to common diseases that show geographical disparities, such as autoimmune and metabolic disorders. Using new high-throughput technologies, analytical methods and expanding public data resources, the investigation of natural selection is leading to new insights into the function and dysfunction of human biology.},

The number and length of ROH reflect individual demographic history, while the homozygosity burden can be used to investigate the genetic architecture of complex disease.

In such populations, shared haplotypes allow imputation of variants in unsequenced samples without resorting to complex statistical methods as in studies of outbred cohorts. We focus on an isolated population cohort from the Paciﬁc Island of Kosrae, Micronesia, where we previously collected SNP array and rich phenotype data for the majority of the population. We report identiﬁcation of long regions with haplotypes co-inherited between pairs of individuals and methodology to leverage such shared genetic content for imputation. Our estimates show that sequencing as few as 40 personal genomes allows for inference in up to 60\% of the 3000-person cohort at the average locus. We ascertained a pilot data set of whole-genome sequences from seven Kosraean individuals, with average 5· coverage. This assay identiﬁed 5,735,306 unique sites of which 1,212,831 were previously unknown. Additionally, these variants are unusually enriched for alleles that are rare in other populations when compared to geographic neighbors (published Korean genome SJK). We used the presence of shared haplotypes between the seven Kosraen individuals to estimate expected imputation accuracy of known and novel homozygous variants at 99.6\% and 97.3\%, respectively. This study presents whole-genome analysis of a homogenous isolate population with emphasis on optimal rare variant inference.},

	abstract = {Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program
              structure
              . Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to
              structure
              . We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in
              structure
              . However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take
              structure
              hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as
              structure
              's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from
              structure
              and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies.},

Here I show that for SNP data the projection of samples onto the principal components can be obtained directly from considering the average coalescent times between pairs of haploid genomes. The result provides a framework for interpreting PCA projections in terms of underlying processes, including migration, geographical isolation, and admixture. I also demonstrate a link between PCA and Wright’s FST and show that SNP ascertainment has a largely simple and predictable effect on the projection of samples.

The approach exploits the co-appearances of rare genetic variants in individuals. The method can be applied to all available genetic loci and is computationally fast. Using sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project, the features of the approach are illustrated and compared to existing methodology (i.e. EIGENSTRAT). We examine the effects of different cutoffs for the minor allele frequency on the performance of the approach. We ﬁnd that our approach works particularly well for genetic loci with very small minor allele frequencies. The results suggest that the inclusion of rare-variant data/sequencing data in our approach provides a much higher resolution picture of population substructure than it can be obtained with existing methodology. Furthermore, in simulation studies, we ﬁnd scenarios where our method was able to control the type 1 error more precisely and showed higher power.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the impact of applying for funding on personal workloads, stress and family relationships. Design: Qualitative study of researchers preparing grant proposals. Setting: Web-based survey on applying for the annual National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project Grant scheme. Participants: Australian researchers (n=215).
Results: Almost all agreed that preparing their proposals always took top priority over other work (97\%) and personal (87\%) commitments. Almost all researchers agreed that they became stressed by the workload (93\%) and restricted their holidays during the grant writing season (88\%). Most researchers agreed that they submitted proposals because chance is involved in being successful (75\%), due to performance requirements at their institution (60\%) and pressure from their colleagues to submit proposals (53\%). Almost all researchers supported changes to the current processes to submit proposals (95\%) and peer review (90\%). Most researchers (59\%) provided extensive comments on the impact of writing proposals on their work life and home life. Six major work life themes were: (1) top priority; (2) career development; (3) stress at work; (4) benefits at work; (5) time spent at work and (6) pressure from colleagues. Six major home life themes were: (1) restricting family holidays; (2) time spent on work at home; (3) impact on children; (4) stress at home; (5) impact on family and friends and (6) impact on partner. Additional impacts on the mental health and well-being of researchers were identified.
Conclusions: The process of preparing grant proposals for a single annual deadline is stressful, time consuming and conflicts with family responsibilities. The timing of the funding cycle could be shifted to minimise applicant burden, give Australian researchers more time to work on actual research and to be with their families.},

Setting Grant review panels of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. Participants Panel members’ scores for grant proposals submitted in 2009. Main outcome measures The proportion of grant proposals that were always, sometimes, and never funded after accounting for random variability arising from differences in panel members’ scores, and the cost effectiveness of different size assessment panels.
Results 59\% of 620 funded grants were sometimes not funded when random variability was taken into account. Only 9\% (n=255) of grant proposals were always funded, 61\% (n=1662) never funded, and 29\% (n=788) sometimes funded. The extra cost per grant effectively funded from the most effective system was \$A18 541 (£11 848; €13 482; \$19 343).
Conclusions Allocating funding for scientific research in health and medicine is costly and somewhat random. There are many useful research questions to be addressed that could improve current processes.},

A number of studies have questioned the ability of peer review panels to predict the productivity of applications, but a recent analysis of grants funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US found that the percentile scores awarded by peer review panels correlated with productivity as measured by citations of grant-supported publications. Here, based on a re-analysis of these data for the 102,740 funded grants with percentile scores of 20 or better, we report that these percentile scores are a poor discriminator of productivity.

Recent work has described decreasing marginal returns as a function of annual dollars granted to individual scientists. However, different fields of research incur varying cost structures. Therefore, we developed a Grant Support Index (GSI) that focuses on grant activity code, as opposed to field of study or cost. In a cohort of over 71,000 unique scientists funded by NIH between 1996 and 2014 we analyzed the association of grant support (as measured by annual GSI) with 3 bibliometric outcomes, maximum Relative Citation Ratio (which arguably reflects a scientist’s most influential work), median Relative Citation Ratio, and annual weighted Relative Citation Ratio (which is more dependent on publication counts). We found that for all 3 measures marginal returns decline as annual GSI increases. Thus, we confirm prior findings of decreasing marginal returns with higher levels of research funding support.},

	abstract = {Scientific research funding is allocated largely through a system of soliciting and ranking competitive grant proposals. In these competitions, the proposals themselves are not the deliverables that the funder seeks, but instead are used by the funder to screen for the most promising research ideas. Consequently, some of the funding program’s impact on science is squandered because applying researchers must spend time writing proposals instead of doing science. To what extent does the community’s aggregate investment in proposal preparation negate the scientific impact of the funding program? Are there alternative mechanisms for awarding funds that advance science more efficiently? We use the economic theory of contests to analyze how efficiently grant proposal competitions advance science, and compare them with recently proposed, partially randomized alternatives such as lotteries. We find that the effort researchers waste in writing proposals may be comparable to the total scientific value of the research that the funding supports, especially when only a few proposals can be funded. Moreover, when professional pressures motivate investigators to seek funding for reasons that extend beyond the value of the proposed science (e.g., promotion, prestige), the entire program can actually hamper scientific progress when the number of awards is small. We suggest that lost efficiency may be restored either by partial lotteries for funding or by funding researchers based on past scientific success instead of proposals for future work.},

This paper investigates the at-work allocation of time among teaching, research, grant writing and service by science and engineering faculty at top US research universities. We focus on the relationship between tenure (and promotion) and time allocation, and we ﬁnd that tenure and promotion do affect the allocation of time. The speciﬁc tradeoffs are related to particular career paths. For example, full professors spend increasing time on service at the expense of teaching and research while longer-term associate professors who have not been promoted to full professor spend signiﬁcantly more time teaching at the expense of research time. Finally, our results suggest that women, on average, allocate more hours to university service and less time to research than do men.},

            Population mixture is an important process in biology. We present a suite of methods for learning about population mixtures, implemented in a software package called ADMIXTOOLS, that support formal tests for whether mixture occurred and make it possible to infer proportions and dates of mixture. We also describe the development of a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array consisting of 629,433 sites with clearly documented ascertainment that was specifically designed for population genetic analyses and that we genotyped in 934 individuals from 53 diverse populations. To illustrate the methods, we give a number of examples that provide new insights about the history of human admixture. The most striking finding is a clear signal of admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population related to present-day Basques and Sardinians and the other related to present-day populations of northeast Asia and the Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from Sweden and the sequencing of the genome of the Tyrolean “Iceman.”},

Instead, modern Papuans carry hundreds of gene variants from two deeply divergent Denisovan lineages that separated over 350 thousand years ago. Spatial and temporal structure among these lineages suggest that introgression from one of these Denisovan groups predominantly took place east of the Wallace line and continued until near the end of the Pleistocene. A third Denisovan lineage occurs in modern East Asians. This regional mosaic suggests considerable complexity in archaic contact, with modern humans interbreeding with multiple Denisovan groups that were geographically isolated from each other over deep evolutionary time.},

I explain how this leads to a differential structuring of Chinese identiﬁcations between a ‘local’ and a ‘cosmopolitan’ pole. Instead of assuming that the descendants of Chinese migrants constitute a homogeneous entity, it is their differing identiﬁcations that are brought to the fore. I examine the conditions of possibility that might account for the sense of belonging to a ‘Chinese diaspora’, and its relation to the maintenance of the ethnic Chinese category in French Polynesia.

These characteristics, which constitute a trait’s genetic architecture, can dramatically affect evolutionary outcomes in applications from agriculture to medicine, and can provide a window into how evolution works. Here, I review theoretical predictions about the evolution of genetic architecture under spatially homogeneous, global adaptation as compared with spatially heterogeneous, local adaptation. Due to the tension between divergent selection and migration, local adaptation can favor “concentrated” genetic architectures that are enriched for alleles of larger effect, clustered in a smaller number of genomic regions, relative to expectations under global adaptation. However, the evolution of such architectures may be limited by many factors, including the genotypic redundancy of the trait, mutation rate, and temporal variability of environment. I review the circumstances in which predictions differ for global vs local adaptation and discuss where progress can be made in testing hypotheses using data from natural populations and lab experiments. As the ﬁeld of comparative population genomics expands in scope, differences in architecture among traits and species will provide insights into how evolution works, and such differences must be interpreted in light of which kind of selection has been operating.},

To cause pain to others is typically condemned. To cosset pain and suffering is said to be perverse. My main point is we that can better understand BDSM via its typical language and rhetoric, especially by paying attention to the key role of linguistic metonymy when we discuss the riddles of pain and pleasure. Also, this article discusses the various ways of talking about and potentially condemning BDSM by calling it a perversion or a paraphilic disorder.

	abstract = {Background: PLINK is probably the most used program for analyzing SNP genotypes and runs of homozygosity (ROH), both in human and in animal populations. The last decade, ROH analyses have become the state-of-the-art method for inbreeding assessment. In PLINK, the --homozyg function is used to perform ROH analyses and relies on several input settings. These settings can have a large impact on the outcome and default values are not always appropriate for medium density SNP array data. Guidelines for a robust and uniform ROH analysis in PLINK using medium density data are lacking, albeit these guidelines are vital for comparing different ROH studies. In this study, 8 populations of different livestock and pet species are used to demonstrate the importance of PLINK input settings. Moreover, the effects of pruning SNPs for low minor allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium on ROH detection are shown.
Results: We introduce the genome coverage parameter to appropriately estimate FROH and to check the validity of ROH analyses. The effect of pruning for linkage disequilibrium and low minor allele frequencies on ROH analyses is highly population dependent and such pruning may result in missed ROH. PLINK’s minimal density requirement is crucial for medium density genotypes and if set too low, genome coverage of the ROH analysis is limited. Finally, we provide recommendations for the maximal gap, scanning window length and threshold settings.
Conclusions: In this study, we present guidelines for an adequate and robust ROH analysis in PLINK on medium density SNP data. Furthermore, we advise to report parameter settings in publications, and to validate them prior to analysis. Moreover, we encourage authors to report genome coverage to reflect the ROH analysis’ validity. Implementing these guidelines will substantially improve the overall quality and uniformity of ROH analyses.},

It is commonly assumed that these lengths can be modeled as independently and identically distributed (iid) exponential random variables. This assumption is fundamental for many popular methods that analyze admixture using hidden Markov models. We compare the expected distribution of admixture tract lengths under a number of population-genetic models to the distribution predicted by the Wright–Fisher model with recombination. We show that under the latter model, the assumption of iid exponential tract lengths does not hold for recent or for ancient admixture events and that relying on this assumption can lead to false positives when inferring the number of admixture events. To further investigate the tract-length distribution, we develop a dyadic interval-based stochastic process for generating admixture tracts. This representation is useful for analyzing admixture tract-length distributions for populations with recent admixture, a scenario in which existing models perform poorly.},

We develop theoretical results that can accurately predict means and variances of admixture proportions within a population using models with recombination and genetic drift. Based on established theory on measures of multilocus disequilibrium, we show that there is a set of recurrence relations that can be used to derive expectations for higher moments of the admixture fraction distribution. We obtain closed form solutions for some special cases. Using these results, we develop a method for estimating admixture parameters from estimated admixture proportion obtained from programs such as Structure or Admixture. We apply this method to HapMap data and ﬁnd that the population history of African Americans, as expected, is not best explained by a single admixture event between people of European and African ancestry.

This ‘genetic load’ has been estimated in a wide range of animal taxa using various approaches.

Here, we review the classic and contemporary literature of genetic load. We describe approaches to quantify the genetic load in whole-g enome sequence data based on evolutionary conservation and annotations. We show that splitting the load into its two components — the realized load (or expressed load) and the masked load (or inbreeding load) — can improve our understanding of the population genetics of deleterious mutations.},

However, the number of migratory waves and the origin of immigrants are still controversial topics. Here, we show the Australasian genetic signal is present in the Pacific coast region, indicating a more widespread signal distribution within South America and implicating an ancient contact between Pacific and Amazonian dwellers. We demonstrate that the Australasian population contribution was introduced in South America through the Pacific coastal route before the formation of the Amazonian branch, likely in the ancient coastal Pacific/Amazonian population. In addition, we detected a significant amount of interpopulation and intrapopulation variation in this genetic signal in South America. This study elucidates the genetic relationships of different ancestral components in the initial settlement of South America and proposes that the migratory route used by migrants who carried the Australasian ancestry led to the absence of this signal in the populations of Central and North America.},

              The expansion into the Americas by the ancestors of present day Native Americans has been difficult to tease apart from analyses of present day populations. To understand how humans diverged and spread across North and South America, Moreno-Mayar
              et al.
              sequenced 15 ancient human genomes from Alaska to Patagonia. Analysis of the oldest genomes suggests that there was an early split within Beringian populations, giving rise to the Northern and Southern lineages. Because population history cannot be explained by simple models or patterns of dispersal, it seems that people moved out of Beringia and across the continents in a complex manner.

            Ancient genomes from the Americas show a complex genetic history giving rise to present-day diversity.

              INTRODUCTION
              Genetic studies of the Pleistocene peopling of the Americas have focused on the timing and number of migrations from Siberia into North America. They show that ancestral Native Americans (NAs) diverged from Siberians and East Asians {\textasciitilde}23,000 years ({\textasciitilde}23 ka) ago and that a split within that ancestral lineage between later NAs and Ancient Beringians (ABs) occurred {\textasciitilde}21 ka ago. Subsequently, NAs diverged into northern NA (NNA) and southern NA (SNA) branches {\textasciitilde}15.5 ka ago, a split inferred to have taken place south of eastern Beringia (present-day Alaska and western Yukon Territory).
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Claims of migrations into the Americas by people related to Australasians or by bearers of a distinctive cranial morphology (“Paleoamericans”) before the divergence of NAs from Siberians and East Asians have created controversy. Likewise, the speed by which the Americas were populated; the number of basal divergences; and the degrees of isolation, admixture, and continuity in different regions are poorly understood. To address these matters, we sequenced 15 ancient human genomes recovered from sites spanning from Alaska to Patagonia; six are ≥10 ka old (up to {\textasciitilde}18× coverage).
            
            
              RESULTS
              All genomes are most closely related to NAs, including those of two morphologically distinct Paleoamericans and an AB individual. However, we also found that the previous model is just a rough outline of the peopling process: NA dispersal gave rise to more complex serial splitting and early population structure—including that of a population that diverged before the NNA-SNA split—as well as admixture with an earlier unsampled population, which is neither AB nor NNA or SNA. Once in the Americas, SNAs spread widely and rapidly, as evidenced by genetic similarity, despite differences in material cultural, between {\textgreater}10-ka-old genomes from North and South America. Soon after arrival in South America, groups diverged along multiple geographic paths, and before 10.4 ka ago, these groups admixed with a population that harbored Australasian ancestry, which may have been widespread among early South Americans. Later, Mesoamerican-related population(s) expanded north and south, possibly marking the movement of relatively small groups that did not necessarily swamp local populations genetically or culturally.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              NAs radiated rapidly and gave rise to multiple groups, some visible in the genetic record only as unsampled populations. At different times these groups expanded to different portions of the continent, though not as extensively as in the initial peopling. That the early population spread widely and rapidly suggests that their access to large portions of the hemisphere was essentially unrestricted, yet there are genomic and archaeological hints of an earlier human presence. How these early groups are related or structured, particularly those with Australasian ancestry, remains unknown. Rapid expansion, compounded by the attenuating effect of distance and, in places, by geographic and social barriers, gave rise to complex population histories. These include strong population structure in the Pacific Northwest; isolation in the North American Great Basin, followed by long-term genetic continuity and ultimately an episode of admixture predating {\textasciitilde}0.7 ka ago; and multiple independent, geographically uneven migrations into South America. One such migration provides clues of Late Pleistocene Australasian ancestry in South America, whereas another represents a Mesoamerican-related expansion; both contributed to present-day South American ancestry.

            Studies of the peopling of the Americas have focused on the timing and number of initial migrations. Less attention has been paid to the subsequent spread of people within the Americas. We sequenced 15 ancient human genomes spanning from Alaska to Patagonia; six are ≥10,000 years old (up to {\textasciitilde}18× coverage). All are most closely related to Native Americans, including those from an Ancient Beringian individual and two morphologically distinct “Paleoamericans.” We found evidence of rapid dispersal and early diversification that included previously unknown groups as people moved south. This resulted in multiple independent, geographically uneven migrations, including one that provides clues of a Late Pleistocene Australasian genetic signal, as well as a later Mesoamerican-related expansion. These led to complex and dynamic population histories from North to South America.},

Despite the role NAGC plays in various genetic diseases and the concerted evolution of gene families, the parameters that govern NAGC are not well characterized. Here, we survey duplicate gene families and identify converted tracts in 46\% of them. These conversions reflect a large GC bias of NAGC. We develop a sequence evolution model that leverages substantially more information in duplicate sequences than used by previous methods and use it to estimate the parameters that govern NAGC in humans: a mean converted tract length of 250 bp and a probability of

As a result, NAGC has a small average effect on the sequence divergence of duplicates.

However, some evidence of an early South American contact also exists (the sweet potato, bottle gourd etc.), but genetic studies have so far failed to show an early Amerindian contribution to the gene pool on Easter Island. To address this issue, we analyzed mtDNA and Y chromosome markers and performed high-resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping of DNA harvested from previously collected sera of 48 reputedly nonadmixed native Easter Islanders. All individuals carried mtDNA types and HLA alleles previously found in Polynesia, and most men carried Y chromosome markers of Polynesian origin, providing further evidence of a Polynesian origin of the population of Easter Island. A few individuals carried HLA alleles and/or Y chromosome markers of European origin. More interestingly, some individuals carried the HLA alleles A*0212 and B*3905, which are of typical Amerindian origin. The genealogy of some of the individuals carrying these non-Polynesian HLA alleles and their haplotypic backgrounds suggest an introduction into Easter Island in the early 1800s, or earlier. Thus, there may have been an early European and Amerindian contribution to the Polynesian gene pool of Easter Island.},

There are, however, many indications of a ‘prehistoric’ (i.e. before Polynesia was discovered by Europeans) contact between Polynesia and the Americas, but genetic evidence of a prehistoric Amerindian contribution to the Polynesian gene pool has been lacking. We recently carried out genomic HLA (human leucocyte antigen) typing as well as typing for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosome markers of blood samples collected in 1971 and 2008 from reputedly non-admixed Easter Islanders. All individuals carried HLA alleles and mtDNA types previously found in Polynesia, and most of the males carried Y chromosome markers of Polynesian origin (a few had European Y chromosome markers), further supporting an initial Polynesian population on Easter Island. The HLA investigations revealed, however, that some individuals also carried HLA alleles which have previously almost only been found in Amerindians. We could trace the introduction of these Amerindian alleles to before the Peruvian slave trades, i.e. before the 1860s, and provide suggestive evidence that they were introduced already in prehistoric time. Our results demonstrate an early Amerindian contribution to the Polynesian gene pool on Easter Island, and illustrate the usefulness of typing for immunogenetic markers such as HLA to complement mtDNA and Y chromosome analyses in anthropological investigations.},

Most existing methods for detecting and reconstructing historical admixture events are based on allele frequency divergences or patterns of ancestry segments in chromosomes of admixed individuals. An emerging new approach harnesses the exponential decay of admixture-induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) as a function of genetic distance. Here, we comprehensively develop LD-based inference into a versatile tool for investigating admixture. We present a new weighted LD statistic that can be used to infer mixture proportions as well as dates with fewer constraints on reference populations than previous methods. We deﬁne an LDbased three-population test for admixture and identify scenarios in which it can detect admixture events that previous formal tests cannot. We further show that we can uncover phylogenetic relationships among populations by comparing weighted LD curves obtained using a suite of references. Finally, we describe several improvements to the computation and ﬁtting of weighted LD curves that greatly increase the robustness and speed of the calculations. We implement all of these advances in a software package, ALDER, which we validate in simulations and apply to test for admixture among all populations from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), highlighting insights into the admixture history of Central African Pygmies, Sardinians, and Japanese.},

The method can analyze multiple populations simultaneously and retains power to detect selection signatures speciﬁc to ancestry components that are not representative of any extant populations. Using simulated data, we compare our method to related approaches, and show that it is orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, while retaining similar or higher power for most simulation scenarios. We also apply it to human genomic data and identify loci with extreme genetic differentiation between major geographic groups. Many of the genes identiﬁed are previously known selected loci relating to hair pigmentation and morphology, skin, and eye pigmentation. We also identify new candidate regions, including various selected loci in the Native American component of admixed Mexican-Americans. These involve diverse biological functions, such as immunity, fat distribution, food intake, vision, and hair development.},

	abstract = {Genetic material sequenced from ancient samples is revolutionizing our understanding of the recent evolutionary past. However, ancient DNA is often degraded, resulting in low coverage, error-prone sequencing. Several solutions exist to this problem, ranging from simple approach, such as selecting a read at random for each site, to more complicated approaches involving genotype likelihoods. In this work, we present a novel method for assessing the relationship of an ancient sample with a modern population, while accounting for sequencing error and postmortem damage by analyzing raw reads from multiple ancient individuals simultaneously. We show that, when analyzing SNP data, it is better to sequence more ancient samples to low coverage: two samples sequenced to 0.53 coverage provide better resolution than a single sample sequenced to 23 coverage. We also examined the power to detect whether an ancient sample is directly ancestral to a modern population, ﬁnding that, with even a few high coverage individuals, even ancient samples that are very slightly diverged from the modern population can be detected with ease. When we applied our approach to European samples, we found that no ancient samples represent direct ancestors of modern Europeans. We also found that, as shown previously, the most ancient Europeans appear to have had the smallest effective population sizes, indicating a role for agriculture in modern population growth.},

	abstract = {Background: Rapa Nui (Easter Island), located in the easternmost corner of the Polynesian Triangle, is one of the most isolated locations on the planet inhabited by humans. Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the island was ﬁrst colonized by Polynesians around AD 1200, during their eastward expansion. Although it remains contentious whether Polynesians reached South America, suggestive evidence has been brought forward supporting the possibility of Native American contact prior to the European ‘‘discovery’’ of the island in AD 1722.
Results: We generated genome-wide data for 27 Rapanui. We found a mostly Polynesian ancestry among Rapanui and detected genome-wide patterns consistent with Native American and European admixture. By considering the distribution of local ancestry tracts of eight unrelated Rapanui, we found statistical support for Native American admixture dating to AD 1280–1495 and European admixture dating to AD 1850–1895.
Conclusions: These genetic results can be explained by one or more pre-European trans-Paciﬁc contacts.},

EAN’s main strategy has been the setting up of targeted working groups, each bringing together Councillors, engaged citizens and providers, and each tackling a speciﬁc area of climate action through a combination of infrastructure, institutional and behavioural changes. As an environmental anthropologist living in Eastbourne, I was involved in this process right from the beginning, having had my own ‘ecophany’—the realisation that the climate emergency required urgent action—in February 2019. Two years and one pandemic later, in this paper I reﬂect on the overall experiences and challenges of EAN’s and Eastbourne Borough Council’s work towards townwide carbon neutrality to date, discussing possible factors (structural and other) determining varying successes and failures. At the same time, this paper provides an auto-ethnographic account of what ‘engaged anthropology’ means in practice, mapping out the real contributions anthropologists can and should make in local climate action, but also reﬂecting on challenges encountered along the way.},

They crossed more than 2,000 km of open ocean to get there, whereas voyages of similar length did not occur anywhere else until more than 2,000 y later. Yet, the settlement of Polynesia has received far more attention than the settlement of the Marianas. There is uncertainty over both the origin of the first colonizers of the Marianas (with different lines of evidence suggesting variously the Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea, or the Bismarck Archipelago) as well as what, if any, relationship they might have had with the first colonizers of Polynesia. To address these questions, we obtained ancient DNA data from two skeletons from the Ritidian Beach Cave Site in northern Guam, dating to ∼2,200 y ago. Analyses of complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequences and genome-wide SNP data strongly support ancestry from the Philippines, in agreement with some interpretations of the linguistic and archaeological evidence, but in contradiction to results based on computer simulations of sea voyaging. We also find a close link between the ancient Guam skeletons and early Lapita individuals from Vanuatu and Tonga, suggesting that the Marianas and Polynesia were colonized from the same source population, and raising the possibility that the Marianas played a role in the eventual settlement of Polynesia.},

              et al.
              surveyed archaic genomic sequences in a worldwide sample of modern humans, including 35 individuals from the Melanesian Islands. All non-African genomes surveyed contained Neandertal DNA, but a significant Denisovan component was found only in the Melanesians. Reconstruction of this genetic history suggests that Neandertals bred with modern humans multiple times, but Denosivans only once, in ancestors of modern-day Melanesians.

            Although Neandertal sequences that persist in the genomes of modern humans have been identified in Eurasians, comparable studies in people whose ancestors hybridized with both Neandertals and Denisovans are lacking. We developed an approach to identify DNA inherited from multiple archaic hominin ancestors and applied it to whole-genome sequences from 1523 geographically diverse individuals, including 35 previously unknown Island Melanesian genomes. In aggregate, we recovered 1.34 gigabases and 303 megabases of the Neandertal and Denisovan genome, respectively. We use these maps of archaic sequences to show that Neandertal admixture occurred multiple times in different non-African populations, characterize genomic regions that are significantly depleted of archaic sequences, and identify signatures of adaptive introgression.},

Current methods for estimating the very recent historical Ne are unable to detect complex demographic trajectories involving multiple episodes of bottlenecks, drops, and expansions. We develop a theoretical and computational framework to infer the demographic history of a population within the past 100 generations from the observed spectrum of linkage disequilibrium (LD) of pairs of loci over a wide range of recombination rates in a sample of contemporary individuals. The cumulative contributions of all of the previous generations to the observed LD are included in our model, and a genetic algorithm is used to search for the sequence of historical Ne values that best explains the observed LD spectrum. The method can be applied from large samples to samples of fewer than ten individuals using a variety of genotyping and DNA sequencing data: haploid, diploid with phased or unphased genotypes and pseudohaploid data from low-coverage sequencing. The method was tested by computer simulation for sensitivity to genotyping errors, temporal heterogeneity of samples, population admixture, and structural division into subpopulations, showing high tolerance to deviations from the assumptions of the model. Computer simulations also show that the proposed method outperforms other leading approaches when the inference concerns recent timeframes. Analysis of data from a variety of human and animal populations gave results in agreement with previous estimations by other methods or with records of historical events.},

The archaeology of European colonialism has shown the proliferation of ‘hybrid’ identities that emerged from relatively recent cross-cultural encounters (though this concept is not without its critics). We argue that this perspective can also inform interpretations of the deeper past, with specific reference to ongoing research in the Polynesian Outliers of Futuna and Aniwa, south Vanuatu. Polynesian Outliers represent precisely the kinds of cross-cultural spaces where hybrid identities likely emerged during the pre-European era. A theoretical approach drawing on archaeological approaches to hybridity and ethnogenetic theories applied to the south Vanuatu Outliers allows for a clearer understanding of the roles difference and familiarity played in identity formation in the past.},

We note that the general dispersal pattern of founding human populations in the remote islands of the Paciﬁc and long-distance interaction spheres continue to reﬂect well-established models. New research suggests that the formation of an Ancestral Polynesia Culture in Western Polynesia may have involved differential patterns of dispersal followed by signiﬁcant later migrations. It has also been suggested that the pause between the settlement of Western and Eastern Polynesia was centuries longer than currently thought, followed by a remarkably rapid pulse of island colonization. Long-distance travel between islands of the Paciﬁc is currently best documented through the sourcing of artifacts, while the discovery of admixture of Native American DNA within the genome of the people from Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is strong new evidence for sustained contacts between Polynesia and the Americas.},

            Our exploration of the genetic constitution of Nuku Hiva (n = 51), Hiva Oa (n = 28) and Tahuata (n = 8) of the Marquesas Archipelago based on the analyses of genome-wide autosomal markers as well as high-resolution genotyping of paternal and maternal lineages provides us with information on the origins and settlement of these islands at the fringe of the Austronesian expansion. One widespread theme that emerges from this study is the genetic uniformity and relative isolation exhibited by the Marquesas and Society populations. This genetic homogeneity within East Polynesia groups is reflected in their limited average heterozygosity, uniformity of constituents in the Structure analyses, reiteration of complete mtDNA sequences, marked separation from Asian and other Oceanic populations in the PC analyses, limited differentiation in the PCAs and large number of IBD segments in common. Both the f3 and the Outgroup f3 results provide indications of intra-East Polynesian gene flow that may have promoted the observed intra-East Polynesia genetic homogeneity while ALDER analyses indicate that East Polynesia experienced two gene flow episodes, one relatively recent from Europe that coincides roughly with the European incursion into the region and an early one that may represent the original settlement of the islands by Austronesians. Median Network analysis based on high-resolution Y-STR loci under C2a-M208 generates a star-like topology with East Polynesian groups (especially from the Society Archipelago) in central stem positions and individuals from the different populations radiating out one mutational step away while several Samoan and outlier individuals occupy peripheral positions. This arrangement of populations is congruent with dispersals of C2a-M208 Y chromosomes from East Polynesia as a migration hub signaling dispersals in various directions. The equivalent ages of the C2a-M208 lineage of the populations in the Network corroborate an east to west flow of the most abundant Polynesian Y chromosome.},

	title = {Batch effects in population genomic studies with low‐coverage whole genome sequencing data: {Causes}, detection and mitigation},
	abstract = {Over the past few decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of publicly available sequencing data. This opens new opportunities for combining data sets to achieve unprecedented sample sizes, spatial coverage or temporal replication in population genomic studies. However, a common concern is that nonbiological differences between data sets may generate patterns of variation in the data that can confound real biological patterns, a problem known as batch effects. In this paper, we compare two batches of low-­coverage whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) data generated from the same populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). First, we show that with a “batch-e­ ffect-­naive” bioinformatic pipeline, batch effects systematically biased our genetic diversity estimates, population structure inference and selection scans. We then demonstrate that these batch effects resulted from multiple technical differences between our data sets, including the sequencing chemistry (four-­channel vs. two-­channel), sequencing run, read type (single-­end vs. paired-­end), read length (125 vs. 150 bp), DNA degradation level (degraded vs. well preserved) and sequencing depth (0.8× vs. 0.3× on average). Lastly, we illustrate that a set of simple bioinformatic strategies (such as different read trimming and single nucleotide polymorphism filtering) can be used to detect batch effects in our data and substantially mitigate their impact. We conclude that combining data sets remains a powerful approach as long as batch effects are explicitly accounted for. We focus on lcWGS data in this paper, which may be particularly vulnerable to certain causes of batch effects, but many of our conclusions also apply to other sequencing strategies.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are widely distributed throughout the mainland and islands of Southeast Asia, making them a useful model for understanding the complex biogeographical history resulting from drastic changes in sea levels throughout the Pleistocene. Past studies based on mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of long-tailed macaque museum specimens have traced their colonization patterns throughout the archipelago, but mitogenomes trace only the maternal history. Here, our objectives were to trace phylogeographic patterns of long-tailed macaques using low-coverage nuclear DNA (nDNA) data from museum specimens.
Methods: We performed population genetic analyses and phylogenetic reconstruction on nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from shotgun sequencing of 75 longtailed macaque museum specimens from localities throughout Southeast Asia.
Results: We show that shotgun sequencing of museum specimens yields sufficient genome coverage (average {\textasciitilde}1.7\%) for reconstructing population relationships using SNP data. Contrary to expectations of divergent results between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes for a female philopatric species, phylogeographical patterns based on nuclear SNPs proved to be closely similar to those found using mitogenomes. In particular, population genetic analyses and phylogenetic reconstruction from the nDNA identify two major clades within M. fascicularis: Clade A includes all individuals from the mainland along with individuals from northern Sumatra, while Clade B consists of the remaining island-living individuals, including those from southern Sumatra.
Conclusions: Overall, we demonstrate that low-coverage sequencing of nDNA from museum specimens provides enough data for examining broad phylogeographic patterns, although greater genome coverage and sequencing depth would be needed to distinguish between very closely related populations, such as those throughout the Philippines.},

	abstract = {Background:  Identification of selection signatures between populations is often an important part of a population genetic study. Leveraging high-throughput DNA sequencing larger sample sizes of populations with similar ancestries has become increasingly common. This has led to the need of methods capable of identifying signals of selection in populations with a continuous cline of genetic differentiation. Individuals from continuous populations are inherently challenging to group into meaningful units which is why existing methods rely on principal components analysis for inference of the selection signals. These existing methods require called genotypes as input which is problematic for studies based on low-coverage sequencing data. Materials and methods:  We have extended two principal component analysis based selection statistics to genotype likelihood data and applied them to low-coverage sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project for populations with European and East Asian ancestry to detect signals of selection in samples with continuous population structure.
Results:  Here, we present two selections statistics which we have implemented in the PCAngsd framework. These methods account for genotype uncertainty, opening for the opportunity to conduct selection scans in continuous populations from low and/ or variable coverage sequencing data. To illustrate their use, we applied the methods to low-coverage sequencing data from human populations of East Asian and European ancestries and show that the implemented selection statistics can control the false positive rate and that they identify the same signatures of selection from low-coverage sequencing data as state-of-the-art software using high quality called genotypes.
Conclusion:  We show that selection scans of low-coverage sequencing data of populations with similar ancestry perform on par with that obtained from high quality genotype data. Moreover, we demonstrate that PCAngsd outperform selection statistics obtained from called genotypes from low-coverage sequencing data without the need for ad-hoc filtering.},

The latter primarily originated in Europe and Africa, but also, to a lesser extent, in Asia. We analyze previously understudied genetic connections between Asia and Mexico to infer the timing and source of this genetic ancestry in Mexico. We identify the predominant origin within Southeast Asia—specifically western Indonesian and non-Negrito Filipino sources—and we date its arrival in Mexico to approximately 13 generations ago (1620 CE). This points to a genetic legacy from the seventeenth century Manila galleon trade between the colonial Spanish Philippines and the Pacific port of Acapulco. Indeed, within Mexico we observe the highest level of this trans-Pacific ancestry in Acapulco, located in the state of Guerrero. This colonial Spanish trade route from East Asia to Europe was centred on Mexico and appears in historical records, but its legacy has been largely ignored. Identities and stories were suppressed due to slavery, assimilation of the immigrants as ‘Indios’ and incomplete historical records. Here we characterize this understudied Mexican ancestry.

These often lack a usable reference genome, restricting users to RADseq specific software for processing. However, these come with limitations compared to generic next generation sequencing (NGS) toolkits. Here, we describe and test a simple pipeline for reference-­free RADseq data processing that blends de novo elements from STACKS with the full suite of state-­of-­the art NGS tools. Specifically, we use the de novo RADseq assembly employed by STACKS to create a catalogue of RAD loci that serves as a reference for read mapping, variant calling and site filters. Using RADseq data from 28 zebra sequenced to {\textasciitilde}8x depth-­of-­coverage we evaluate our approach by comparing the site frequency spectra (SFS) to those from alternative pipelines. Most pipelines yielded similar SFS at 8x depth, but only a genotype likelihood based pipeline performed similarly at low sequencing depth (2–­4x). We compared the RADseq SFS with medium-­depth ({\textasciitilde}13x) shotgun sequencing of eight overlapping samples, revealing that the RADseq SFS was persistently slightly skewed towards rare and invariant alleles. Using simulations and human data we confirm that this is expected when there is allelic dropout (AD) in the RADseq data. AD in the RADseq data caused a heterozygosity deficit of {\textasciitilde}16\%, which dropped to {\textasciitilde}5\% after filtering AD. Hence, AD was the most important source of bias in our RADseq data.},

However, with read depths too low to confidently call individual genotypes, lcWGS requires specialized analysis tools that explicitly account for genotype uncertainty. A growing number of such tools have become available, but it can be difficult to get an overview of what types of analyses can be performed reliably with lcWGS data, and how the distribution of sequencing effort between the number of samples analysed and per-­sample sequencing depths affects inference accuracy. In this introductory guide to lcWGS, we first illustrate how the per-­sample cost for lcWGS is now comparable to RAD-­seq and Pool-­seq in many systems. We then provide an overview of software packages that explicitly account for genotype uncertainty in different types of population genomic inference. Next, we use both simulated and empirical data to assess the accuracy of allele frequency, genetic diversity, and linkage disequilibrium estimation, detection of population structure, and selection scans under different sequencing strategies. Our results show that spreading a given amount of sequencing effort across more samples with lower depth per sample consistently improves the accuracy of most types of inference, with a few notable exceptions. Finally, we assess the potential for using imputation to bolster inference from lcWGS data in nonmodel species, and discuss current limitations and future perspectives for lcWGS-­ based population genomics research. With this overview, we hope to make lcWGS more approachable and stimulate its broader adoption.},

	abstract = {To inform continuous and rigorous reﬂection about the description of human populations in genomics research, this study investigates the historical and contemporary use of the terms ‘‘ancestry,’’ ‘‘ethnicity,’’ ‘‘race,’’ and other population labels in The American Journal of Human Genetics from 1949 to 2018. We characterize these terms’ frequency of use and assess their odds of co-occurrence with a set of social and genetic topical terms. Throughout The Journal’s 70-year history, ‘‘ancestry’’ and ‘‘ethnicity’’ have increased in use, appearing in 33\% and 26\% of articles in 2009–2018, while the use of ‘‘race’’ has decreased, occurring in 4\% of articles in 2009–2018. Although its overall use has declined, the odds of ‘‘race’’ appearing in the presence of ‘‘ethnicity’’ has increased relative to the odds of occurring in its absence. Forms of population descriptors ‘‘Caucasian’’ and ‘‘Negro’’ have largely disappeared from The Journal ({\textless}1\% of articles in 2009–2018). Conversely, the continental labels ‘‘African,’’ ‘‘Asian,’’ and ‘‘European’’ have increased in use and appear in 18\%, 14\%, and 42\% of articles from 2009–2018, respectively. Decreasing uses of the terms ‘‘race,’’ ‘‘Caucasian,’’ and ‘‘Negro’’ are indicative of a transition away from the ﬁeld’s history of explicitly biological race science; at the same time, the increasing use of ‘‘ancestry,’’ ‘‘ethnicity,’’ and continental labels should serve to motivate ongoing reﬂection as the terminology used to describe genetic variation continues to evolve.},

	abstract = {The current standard practice for assembling individual genomes involves mapping millions of short DNA sequences (also known as DNA ‘reads’) against a pre-constructed reference genome. Mapping vast amounts of short reads in a timely manner is a computationally challenging task that inevitably produces artefacts, including biases against alleles not found in the reference genome. This reference bias and other mapping artefacts are expected to be exacerbated in ancient DNA (aDNA) studies, which rely on the analysis of low quantities of damaged and very short DNA fragments (∼30–80 bp). Nevertheless, the current gold-standard mapping strategies for aDNA studies have effectively remained unchanged for nearly a decade, during which time new software has emerged. In this study, we used simulated aDNA reads from three different human populations to benchmark the performance of 30 distinct mapping strategies implemented across four different read mapping software—BWA-aln, BWA-mem, NovoAlign and Bowtie2—and quantified the impact of reference bias in downstream population genetic analyses. We show that specific NovoAlign, BWA-aln and BWA-mem parameterizations achieve high mapping precision with low levels of reference bias, particularly after filtering out reads with low mapping qualities. However, unbiased NovoAlign results required the use of an IUPAC reference genome. While relevant only to aDNA projects where reference population data are available, the benefit of using an IUPAC reference demonstrates the value of incorporating population genetic information into the aDNA mapping process, echoing recent results based on graph genome representations.},

The timing and pattern of this colonization event has been poorly resolved, with chronologies varying by {\textgreater}1000 y, precluding understanding of cultural change and ecological impacts on these pristine ecosystems. In a meta-analysis of 1,434 radiocarbon dates from the region, reliable short-lived samples reveal that the colonization of East Polynesia occurred in two distinct phases: earliest in the Society Islands A.D. ∼1025–1120, four centuries later than previously assumed; then after 70–265 y, dispersal continued in one major pulse to all remaining islands A.D. ∼1190–1290. We show that previously supported longer chronologies have relied upon radiocarbon-dated materials with large sources of error, making them unsuitable for precise dating of recent events. Our empirically based and dramatically shortened chronology for the colonization of East Polynesia resolves longstanding paradoxes and offers a robust explanation for the remarkable uniformity of East Polynesian culture, human biology, and language. Models of human colonization, ecological change and historical linguistics for the region now require substantial revision.},

Current methods utilizing information combined from several summary statistics typically assume no correlation of summary statistics regardless of the genomic location from which they are calculated. However, due to linkage disequilibrium, summary statistics calculated at nearby genomic positions are highly correlated. We introduce an approach termed Trendsetter that accounts for the similarity of statistics calculated from adjacent genomic regions through trend ﬁltering, while reducing the effects of multicollinearity through regularization. Our penalized regression framework has high power to detect sweeps, is capable of classifying sweep regions as either hard or soft, and can be applied to other selection scenarios as well. We ﬁnd that Trendsetter is robust to both extensive missing data and strong background selection, and has comparable power to similar current approaches. Moreover, the model learned by Trendsetter can be viewed as a set of curves modeling the spatial distribution of summary statistics in the genome. Application to human genomic data revealed positively selected regions previously discovered such as LCT in Europeans and EDAR in East Asians. We also identiﬁed a number of novel candidates and show that populations with greater relatedness share more sweep signals.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The Vanuatu archipelago served as a gateway to Remote Oceania during one of the most extensive human migrations to uninhabited lands {\textasciitilde}3,200 years ago. Ancient DNA studies suggest an initial settlement by East Asian-related peoples that was quickly followed by the arrival of Papuan-related populations, leading to a major population turnover. Yet, there is uncertainty over the population processes and the sociocultural factors that have shaped the genomic diversity of ni-Vanuatu, who present nowadays among the world’s highest linguistic and cultural diversity. Here, we report genome-wide data for 1,433 contemporary ni-Vanuatu from 29 different islands, including 287 couples. We find that ni-Vanuatu derive their East Asian- and Papuan-related ancestry from the same source populations and descend from relatively synchronous admixture events that occurred {\textasciitilde}1,700-2,300 years ago, indicating a peopling history common to all the archipelago. However, our analyses reveal that the Papuan population turnover was geographically uneven, and that the genetic contribution of Papuan-related peoples was male-biased. Furthermore, we detect Polynesian ancestry arriving −600-1,000 years ago to South Vanuatu, and map its distribution to both Polynesian- and non-Polynesian-speaking islands. Lastly, we provide evidence for a tendency of spouses to carry similar genetic ancestry, when accounting for relatedness avoidance. The signal is not driven by strong genetic effects of specific loci or trait-associated variants, suggesting that it results instead from social assortative mating. Altogether, our findings provide insight into both the genetic history of ni-Vanuatu populations and how sociocultural processes have shaped the diversity of their genomes.
          
            Significance statement
            Vanuatu served as a gateway for the peopling of Remote Oceania but how demography and culture have shaped the genomic diversity of its peoples remains partially understood. Here, we report genomic data for 1,433 contemporary ni-Vanuatu covering 29 islands. We demonstrate that their genomic diversity derives from relatively synchronous, geographically uneven and sex-biased admixture events between the Austronesian-related first settlers and the Papuan-related subsequent incomers. We show that the more recent arrival of Polynesian ancestry did not always trigger shifts to Polynesian languages. Lastly, we find evidence for non-random mating, probably owing to social assortative mating. Our findings reveal the impact of multiple migrations, admixture and sociocultural practices on the genomic landscape of a key region of the South Pacific.},

	abstract = {Background: One of the approaches to detect genetics variants affecting fitness traits is to identify their surrounding genomic signatures of past selection. With established methods for detecting selection signatures and the current and future availability of large datasets, such studies should have the power to not only detect these signatures but also to infer their selective histories. Domesticated animals offer a powerful model for these approaches as they adapted rapidly to environmental and human-mediated constraints in a relatively short time. We investigated this question by studying a large dataset of 542 individuals from 27 domestic sheep populations raised in France, genotyped for more than 500,000 SNPs.
Results: Population structure analysis revealed that this set of populations harbour a large part of European sheep diversity in a small geographical area, offering a powerful model for the study of adaptation. Identification of extreme SNP and haplotype frequency differences between populations listed 126 genomic regions likely affected by selection. These signatures revealed selection at loci commonly identified as selection targets in many species (“selection hotspots”) including ABCG2, LCORL/NCAPG, MSTN, and coat colour genes such as ASIP, MC1R, MITF, and TYRP1. For one of these regions (ABCG2, LCORL/NCAPG), we could propose a historical scenario leading to the introgression of an adaptive allele into a new genetic background. Among selection signatures, we found clear evidence for parallel selection events in different genetic backgrounds, most likely for different mutations. We confirmed this allelic heterogeneity in one case by resequencing the MC1R gene in three black-faced breeds.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has made tremendous advances since its inception about seventy years ago. Self-driving cars, programs beating experts at complex games, and smart robots capable of assisting people that need care are just some among the successful examples of machine intelligence. This kind of progress might entice us to envision a society populated by autonomous robots capable of performing the same tasks humans do in the near future. This prospect seems limited only by the power and complexity of current computational devices, which is improving fast. However, there are several significant obstacles on this path. General intelligence involves situational reasoning, taking perspectives, choosing goals, and an ability to deal with ambiguous information. We observe that all of these characteristics are connected to the ability of identifying and exploiting new affordances—opportunities (or impediments) on the path of an agent to achieve its goals. A general example of an affordance is the use of an object in the hands of an agent. We show that it is impossible to predefine a list of such uses. Therefore, they cannot be treated algorithmically. This means that “AI agents” and organisms differ in their ability to leverage new affordances. Only organisms can do this. This implies that true AGI is not achievable in the current algorithmic frame of AI research. It also has important consequences for the theory of evolution. We argue that organismic agency is strictly required for truly open-ended evolution through radical emergence. We discuss the diverse ramifications of this argument, not only in AI research and evolution, but also for the philosophy of science.},

	abstract = {Unequal exchange theory posits that economic growth in the “advanced economies” of the global North relies on a large net appropriation of resources and labour from the global South, extracted through price differentials in international trade. Past attempts to estimate the scale and value of this drain have faced a number of conceptual and empirical limitations, and have been unable to capture the upstream resources and labour embodied in traded goods. Here we use environmental input-output data and footprint analysis to quantify the physical scale of net appropriation from the South in terms of embodied resources and labour over the period 1990 to 2015. We then represent the value of appropriated resources in terms of prevailing market prices. Our results show that in 2015 the North net appropriated from the South 12 billion tons of embodied raw material equivalents, 822 million hectares of embodied land, 21 exajoules of embodied energy, and 188 million person-years of embodied labour, worth \$10.8 trillion in Northern prices – enough to end extreme poverty 70 times over. Over the whole period, drain from the South totalled \$242 trillion (constant 2010 USD). This drain represents a significant windfall for the global North, equivalent to a quarter of Northern GDP. For comparison, we also report drain in global average prices. Using this method, we find that the South’s losses due to unequal exchange outstrip their total aid receipts over the period by a factor of 30. Our analysis confirms that unequal exchange is a significant driver of global inequality, uneven development, and ecological breakdown.},

            Previous research indicates that human genetic diversity in Wallacea—islands in present-day Eastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste that were never part of the Sunda or Sahul continental shelves—has been shaped by complex interactions between migrating Austronesian farmers and indigenous hunter–gatherer communities. Yet, inferences based on present-day groups proved insufficient to disentangle this region’s demographic movements and admixture timings. Here, we investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of variation in Wallacea based on genome-wide data from 16 ancient individuals (2600–250 years BP) from the North Moluccas, Sulawesi and East Nusa Tenggara. While ancestry in the northern islands primarily reflects contact between Austronesian- and Papuan-related groups, ancestry in the southern islands reveals additional contributions from Mainland Southeast Asia that seem to predate the arrival of Austronesians. Admixture time estimates further support multiple and/or continuous admixture involving Papuan- and Asian-related groups throughout Wallacea. Our results clarify previously debated times of admixture and suggest that the Neolithic dispersals into Island Southeast Asia are associated with the spread of multiple genetic ancestries.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the genetic substructure of large cohorts has become increasingly important as genetic association and prediction studies are extended to massive, increasingly diverse, biobanks. ADMIXTURE and STRUCTURE are widely used unsupervised clustering algorithms for characterizing such ancestral genetic structure. These methods decompose individual genomes into fractional cluster assignments with each cluster representing a vector of DNA marker frequencies. The assignments, and clusters, provide an interpretable representation for geneticists to describe population substructure at the sample level. However, with the rapidly increasing size of population biobanks and the growing numbers of variants genotyped (or sequenced) per sample, such traditional methods become computationally intractable. Furthermore, multiple runs with different hyperparameters are required to properly depict the population clustering using these traditional methods, increasing the computational burden. This can lead to days of compute. In this work we present Neural ADMIXTURE, a neural network autoencoder that follows the same modeling assumptions as ADMIXTURE, providing similar (or better) clustering, while reducing the compute time by orders of magnitude. Indeed, the equivalent of one month of continuous compute can be reduced to hours. In addition, Neural ADMIXTURE can include multiple outputs, providing the equivalent results as running the original ADMIXTURE algorithm many times with different numbers of clusters. Our models can also be stored, allowing later cluster assignment to be performed with a linear computational time. The software implementation of Neural ADMIXTURE can be found at https://github.com/ai-sandbox/neural-admixture.},

Fiftyfour sequences from New Zealand Maori show that the mitochondrial variability with just four haplotypes is the lowest of any sizeable human group studied and that the frequency of haplotypes is markedly skewed. The Maori sequences, combined with 268 published sequences from the Pacific, are consistent with a series of founder effects from small populations settling new island groups. The distributions of haplotypes were used to estimate the number of females in founding population of New Zealand Maori. The three-step simulation used a randomly selected founding population from eastern Polynesia, an expansionary phase in New Zealand, and finally the random selection of 54 haplotypes. The results are consistent with a founding population that includes Ϸ70 women (between 50 and 100), and sensitivity analysis shows that this conclusion is robust to small changes in haplotype frequencies. This size is too large for models postulating a very small founding population of ‘‘castaways,’’ but it is consistent with a general understanding of Maori oral history as well as the results of recent canoe voyages recreating early trans-oceanic voyages.},

We show that many commonly used statistics are part of a broad family of two-locus moments whose expectation can be computed jointly and rapidly under a wide range of scenarios, including complex multi-population demographies with continuous migration and admixture events. A full inspection of these statistics reveals that widely used models of human history fail to predict simple patterns of linkage disequilibrium. To jointly capture the information contained in classical and novel statistics, we implemented a tractable likelihood-based inference framework for demographic history. Using this approach, we show that human evolutionary models that include archaic admixture in Africa, Asia, and Europe provide a much better description of patterns of genetic diversity across the human genome. We estimate that an unidentified, deeply diverged population admixed with modern humans within Africa both before and after the split of African and Eurasian populations, contributing 4 − 8\% genetic ancestry to individuals in world-wide populations.},

	abstract = {While it is now broadly accepted that Homo sapiens originated within Africa, considerable uncertainty surrounds specific models of divergence and migration across the continent. Progress is hampered by a paucity of fossil and genomic data, as well as variability in prior divergence time estimates. Here we use linkage disequilibrium and diversity-based statistics, optimized for rapid, complex demographic inference to discriminate among such models. We infer detailed demographic models for populations across Africa, including representatives from eastern and western groups, as well as 44 newly whole-genome sequenced individuals from the Nama (Khoe-San). Despite the complexity of African population history, contemporary population structure dates back to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. The earliest population divergence among contemporary populations occurs 120-135ka, between the Khoe-San and other groups. Prior to the divergence of contemporary African groups, we infer long-lasting structure between two or more weakly differentiated ancestral Homo populations connected by gene flow over hundreds of thousands of years (i.e. a weakly structured stem). We find that weakly structured stem models provide more likely explanations of polymorphism that had previously been attributed to contributions from archaic hominins in Africa. In contrast to models with archaic introgression, we predict that fossil remains from coexisting ancestral populations should be morphologically similar. Despite genetic similarity between these populations, an inferred 1–4\% of genetic differentiation among contemporary human populations can be attributed to genetic drift between stem populations. We show that model misspecification explains variation in previous divergence time estimates and argue that studying a suite of models is key to robust inferences about deep history.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          The field of population genomics has grown rapidly in response to the recent advent of affordable, large-scale sequencing technologies. As opposed to the situation during the majority of the 20th century, in which the development of theoretical and statistical population-genetic insights out-paced the generation of data to which they could be applied, genomic data are now being produced at a far greater rate than they can be meaningfully analyzed and interpreted. With this wealth of data has come a tendency to focus on fitting specific (and often rather idiosyncratic) models to data, at the expense of a careful exploration of the range of possible underlying evolutionary processes. For example, the approach of directly investigating models of adaptive evolution in each newly sequenced population or species often neglects the fact that a thorough characterization of ubiquitous non-adaptive processes is a prerequisite for accurate inference. We here describe the perils of these tendencies, present our consensus views on current best practices in population genomic data analysis, and highlight areas of statistical inference and theory that are in need of further attention. Thereby, we argue for the importance of defining a biologically relevant baseline model tuned to the details of each new analysis, of skepticism and scrutiny in interpreting model-fitting results, and of carefully defining addressable hypotheses and underlying uncertainties.},

Concomitant with this ﬂood of data, theoretical and methodological advances have sought to extract information from genomic sequences to infer demographic events such as population size changes and gene ﬂow among closely related populations/species, construct recombination maps, and uncover loci underlying recent adaptation. To date, most methods make use of only one or a few summaries of the input sequences and therefore ignore potentially useful information encoded in the data. The most sophisticated of these approaches involve likelihood calculations, which require theoretical advances for each new problem, and often focus on a single aspect of the data (e.g., only allele frequency information) in the interest of mathematical and computational tractability. Directly interrogating the entirety of the input sequence data in a likelihood-free manner would thus offer a fruitful alternative. Here, we accomplish this by representing DNA sequence alignments as images and using a class of deep learning methods called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to make population genetic inferences from these images. We apply CNNs to a number of evolutionary questions and ﬁnd that they frequently match or exceed the accuracy of current methods. Importantly, we show that CNNs perform accurate evolutionary model selection and parameter estimation, even on problems that have not received detailed theoretical treatments. Thus, when applied to population genetic alignments, CNNs are capable of outperforming expert-derived statistical methods and offer a new path forward in cases where no likelihood approach exists.},

            Statistical methods for identifying adaptive mutations from population genetic data face several obstacles: assessing the significance of genomic outliers, integrating correlated measures of selection into one analytic framework, and distinguishing adaptive variants from hitchhiking neutral variants. Here, we introduce SWIF(r), a probabilistic method that detects selective sweeps by learning the distributions of multiple selection statistics under different evolutionary scenarios and calculating the posterior probability of a sweep at each genomic site. SWIF(r) is trained using simulations from a user-specified demographic model and explicitly models the joint distributions of selection statistics, thereby increasing its power to both identify regions undergoing sweeps and localize adaptive mutations. Using array and exome data from 45 ‡Khomani San hunter-gatherers of southern Africa, we identify an enrichment of adaptive signals in genes associated with metabolism and obesity. SWIF(r) provides a transparent probabilistic framework for localizing beneficial mutations that is extensible to a variety of evolutionary scenarios.},

Maximum-­likelihood approaches based on allele frequencies and linkage-­disequilibrium have been extensively used to infer admixture processes from genome-­wide data sets, mostly in human populations. Nevertheless, complex admixture histories, beyond one or two pulses of admixture, remain methodologically challenging to reconstruct. We developed an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework to reconstruct highly complex admixture histories from independent genetic markers. We built the software package MetHis to simulate independent SNPs or microsatellites in a two-­way admixed population for scenarios with multiple admixture pulses, monotonically decreasing or increasing recurring admixture, or combinations of these scenarios. MetHis allows users to draw model-p­ arameter values from prior distributions set by the user, and, for each simulation, MetHis can calculate numerous summary statistics describing genetic diversity patterns and moments of the distribution of individual admixture fractions. We coupled MetHis with existing machine-­learning ABC algorithms and investigated the admixture history of admixed populations. Results showed that random forest ABC scenario-­choice could accurately distinguish among most complex admixture scenarios, and errors were mainly found in regions of the parameter space where scenarios were highly nested, and, thus, biologically similar. We focused on African American and Barbadian populations as two study-­cases. We found that neural network ABC posterior parameter estimation was accurate and reasonably conservative under complex admixture scenarios. For both admixed populations, we found that monotonically decreasing contributions over time, from Europe and Africa, explained the observed data more accurately than multiple admixture pulses. This approach will allow for reconstructing detailed admixture histories when maximum-l­ikelihood methods are intractable.},

As the richness and amount of simulated and real genetic data keep increasing, the field has a strong opportunity to tackle tasks that current methods hardly solve. However, high data dimensionality forces most methods to summarize large genomic data sets into a relatively small number of handcrafted features (summary statistics). Here, we propose an alternative to summary statistics, based on the automatic extraction of relevant information using deep learning techniques. Specifically, we design artificial neural networks (ANNs) that take as input single nucleotide polymorphic sites (SNPs) found in individuals sampled from a single population and infer the past effective population size history. First, we provide guidelines to construct artificial neural networks that comply with the intrinsic properties of SNP data such as invariance to permutation of haplotypes, long scale interactions between SNPs and variable genomic length. Thanks to a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization procedure, we evaluate the performance of multiple networks and compare them to well-established methods like Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Even without the expert knowledge of summary statistics, our approach compares fairly well to an ABC approach based on handcrafted features. Furthermore, we show that combining deep learning and ABC can improve performance while taking advantage of both frameworks. Finally, we apply our approach to reconstruct the effective population size history of cattle breed populations.},

	abstract = {Detecting and estimating DNA sample contamination are important steps to ensure high-quality genotype calls and reliable downstream analysis. Existing methods rely on population allele frequency information for accurate estimation of contamination rates. Correctly specifying population allele frequencies for each individual in early stage of sequence analysis is impractical or even impossible for large-scale sequencing centers that simultaneously process samples from multiple studies across diverse populations. On the other hand, incorrectly specified allele frequencies may result in substantial bias in estimated contamination rates. For example, we observed that existing methods often fail to identify 10\% contaminated samples at a typical 3\% contamination exclusion threshold when genetic ancestry is misspecified. Such an incomplete screening of contaminated samples substantially inflates the estimated rate of genotyping errors even in deeply sequenced genomes and exomes. We propose a robust statistical method that accurately estimates DNA contamination and is agnostic to genetic ancestry of the intended or contaminating sample. Our method integrates the estimation of genetic ancestry and DNA contamination in a unified likelihood framework by leveraging individual-specific allele frequencies projected from reference genotypes onto principal component coordinates. Our method can also be used for estimating genetic ancestries, similar to LASER or
              TRACE
              , but simultaneously accounting for potential contamination. We demonstrate that our method robustly estimates contamination rates and genetic ancestries across populations and contamination scenarios. We further demonstrate that, in the presence of contamination, genetic ancestry inference can be substantially biased with existing methods that ignore contamination, while our method corrects for such biases.},

	abstract = {Background: The site frequency spectrum summarizes the distribution of allele frequencies throughout the genome, and it is widely used as a summary statistic to infer demographic parameters and to detect signals of natural selection. The use of high-throughput low-coverage DNA sequencing data can lead to biased estimates of the site frequency spectrum due to high levels of uncertainty in genotyping.
Results: Here we design and implement a method to efficiently and accurately estimate the multidimensional joint site frequency spectrum for large numbers of haploid or diploid individuals across an arbitrary number of populations, using low-coverage sequencing data. The method maximizes a likelihood function that represents the probability of the sequencing data observed given a multidimensional site frequency spectrum using genotype likelihoods. Notably, it uses an advanced binning heuristic paired with an accelerated expectation-maximization algorithm for a fast and memory-efficient computation, and can generate both unfolded and folded spectra and bootstrapped replicates for haploid and diploid genomes. On the basis of extensive simulations, we show that the new method requires remarkably less storage and is faster than previous implementations whilst retaining the same accuracy. When applied to low-coverage sequencing data from the fungal pathogen Neonectria neomacrospora, results recapitulate the patterns of population differentiation generated using the original high-coverage data.
Conclusion: The new implementation allows for accurate estimation of population genetic parameters from arbitrarily large, lowcoverage datasets, thus facilitating cost-effective sequencing experiments in model and non-model organisms.},

            The Tongan state was the only maritime polity in Oceania to encompass an entire archipelago and, through long-distance voyaging, to extend its influence to other island groups through political and economic exchanges. Stone tools recovered from the central places of the Tongan state were geochemically analyzed to provide the first archaeological assessment of maritime interaction in the Central Pacific, with a high proportion of tools (66\%) identified as long-distance imports from Fiji, Samoa, and the Society Islands. Exotic lithics were an important source of political capital used by Tongan elites, and an important consequence of centralization was the development of interaction centers through which people, products, and information about political organizations reached many parts of the prehistoric Pacific.
          , 
            Tonga was unique in the prehistoric Pacific for developing a maritime state that integrated the archipelago under a centralized authority and for undertaking long-distance economic and political exchanges in the second millennium A.D. To establish the extent of Tonga’s maritime polity, we geochemically analyzed stone tools excavated from the central places of the ruling paramounts, particularly lithic artifacts associated with stone-faced chiefly tombs. The lithic networks of the Tongan state focused on Samoa and Fiji, with one adze sourced to the Society Islands 2,500 km from Tongatapu. To test the hypothesis that nonlocal lithics were especially valued by Tongan elites and were an important source of political capital, we analyzed prestate lithics from Tongatapu and stone artifacts from Samoa. In the Tongan state, 66\% of worked stone tools were long-distance imports, indicating that interarchipelago connections intensified with the development of the Tongan polity after A.D. 1200. In contrast, stone tools found in Samoa were from local sources, including tools associated with a monumental structure contemporary with the Tongan state. Network analysis of lithics entering the Tongan state and of the distribution of Samoan adzes in the Pacific identified a centralized polity and the products of specialized lithic workshops, respectively. These results indicate that a significant consequence of social complexity was the establishment of new types of specialized sites in distant geographic areas. Specialized sites were loci of long-distance interaction and formed important centers for the transmission of information, people, and materials in prehistoric Oceania.},

At the end of the eighteenth century, this atoll was presumably controlled by the chiefdom of Porionu’u, which included the districts of Pare and Arue on the north coast of Tahiti. This situation is conﬁrmed by a number of ethnohistorical accounts and oral traditions describing an intense trafﬁc of basic resources between the atoll and Tahiti island as well as the speciﬁc function of Teti’aroa for Tahitian social elites visiting the atoll for ceremonial or recreational purposes. However, the prehistory of the atoll remains largely unknown and the time-depth of dominance by Tahitian elites on the atoll is unclear. In this paper, we investigate potential inter-island relationships between Teti’aroa and other islands in the archipelago and beyond. We present geochemical analyses (energy dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry) of stone tools and elements of ceremonial architecture (marae), which were necessarily imported given the complete subsidence of the volcanic substratum of the island.

	abstract = {Stone tool geochemistry provides hard evidence for post-settlement voyaging and inter-island contacts in East Polynesia. This offers promising information on inter-community exchange networks that are not documented by ethnographic accounts. Drawing on “geochemical ﬁngerprints”, provenance studies have slowly integrated geological data in order to better constrain the origin of archaeological material. However, the occurrence of overlapping geochemical signatures within Polynesian islands can cause difﬁculties when attempting to differentiate sources. Identifying clear geochemical characteristics for each island is therefore critical for a comprehensive understanding of the interaction patterns in East Polynesian societies. In this paper, we combine major and trace element data with isotopes as well as 40Ar-39Ar ages to constrain the local procurement networks that were occurring on the island of Tupua'i (Austral-Cook chain). We also demonstrate that some Tupua'i archaeological material originated from Eiao Island (Marquesas chain) circa 2000 km north. This represents the ﬁrst hard evidence for inter-island connections between the Austral and the Marquesas Archipelagos.},

            Oceania, the last region settled on Earth, witnessed the greatest maritime migration in human history. Scholars have debated how and when islands were colonized and the role of postsettlement voyaging in maintaining founding colonies and in subsequent diversification of island societies. We geochemically “fingerprinted” exotic stone artifacts from a well-dated archaeological site in the Cook Islands, matching artifacts to their geological sources and demonstrating that the geographical voyaging network extended beyond the Cook Islands to include the Austral, Samoa, and Marquesas archipelagos—up to 2,400 km distant. We further demonstrate that Polynesian interarchipelago voyaging lasted from about AD 1300 to the 1600s, suggesting that long-distance interaction continued to influence the development of social structures in East Polynesia well after initial colonization.
          , 
            The Cook Islands are considered the “gateway” for human colonization of East Polynesia, the final chapter of Oceanic settlement and the last major region occupied on Earth. Indeed, East Polynesia witnessed the culmination of the greatest maritime migration in human history. Perennial debates have critiqued whether Oceanic settlement was purposeful or accidental, the timing and pathways of colonization, and the nature and extent of postcolonization voyaging—essential for small founding groups securing a lifeline between parent and daughter communities. Centering on the well-dated Tangatatau rockshelter, Mangaia, Southern Cook Islands, we charted the temporal duration and geographic spread of exotic stone adze materials—essential woodworking tools found throughout Polynesia— imported for more than 300 y beginning in the early AD 1300s. Using a technique requiring only 200 mg of sample for the geochemical analysis of trace elements and isotopes of fine-grained basalt adzes, we assigned all artifacts to an island or archipelago of origin. Adze material was identified from the chiefly complex on the Austral Islands, from the major adze quarry complex on Tutuila (Samoa), and from the Marquesas Islands more than 2,400 km distant. This interaction is the only dated example of down-the-line exchange in central East Polynesia where intermediate groups transferred commodities attesting to the interconnectedness and complexity of social relations fostered during postsettlement voyaging. For the Cook Islands, this exchange may have lasted into the 1600s, at least a century later than other East Polynesian archipelagos, suggesting that interarchipelago interaction contributed to the later development of social hierarchies.},

Universities are promoting an increased focus on sustainability through their research, teaching and their own institutional footprints. However, we suggest that such initiatives will be insufﬁcient to catalyse the required transformations in our societies and economies because of (i) the time lags inherent in education and research pathways to impact, and (ii) their failure to address either real-world political processes or the forces invested in maintaining the status quo. We therefore suggest that academics should move from publications to public actions and engage in advocacy and activism to affect urgent and transformational change. We discuss the barriers to engagement in advocacy that academics face, and propose a number of actions that universities should adopt to help overcome them. These include explicitly recognising advocacy as part of the work mandate of academic staff by altering work allocation models, facilitating engaged research sabbaticals, altering hiring and promotion policies, and providing training to enhance the effectiveness of engagement. In addition, universities must defend the right of academics to engage in protest and push back against emerging threats to academic freedom. Such actions would strengthen a rich tradition of academic protest and enhance the contribution of universities to the public good in areas well beyond sustainability, for example race and social justice (Black Lives Matter, decolonising education) and public health.},

Admixture may be especially important for newly colonized populations, such as during range expansion and species invasions, by generating heterozygosity that can boost ﬁtness through heterosis. Despite widespread evidence for admixture during species invasions, few studies have examined the demographic history leading to admixture, how admixture affects the heterozygosity and ﬁtness of invasive genotypes, and whether such ﬁtness effects are maintained through time. We address these questions using the invasive plant Silene vulgaris, which shows evidence of admixture in both its native Europe and in North America where it has invaded. Using multilocus genotype data in conjunction with approximate Bayesian computation analysis of demographic history, we showed that admixture during the invasion of North America was independent from and much younger than admixture in the native range of Europe. We tested for ﬁtness consequences of admixture in each range and detected a signiﬁcant positive heterozygosity–ﬁtness correlation (HFC) in North America; in contrast, no HFC was present in Europe. The lack of HFC in Europe may reﬂect the longer time since admixture in the native range, dissipating associations between heterozygosity at markers and ﬁtness loci. Our results support a key short-term role for admixture during the early stages of invasion by generating HFCs that carry populations past the threat of extinction from inbreeding and demographic stochasticity.},

Reduced ﬁtness due to the expansion load is not restricted to the wave front, but occurs over a large proportion of newly colonized habitats. The expansion load can persist and represent a major fraction of the total mutation load for thousands of generations after the expansion. The phenomenon of expansion load may explain growing evidence that populations that have recently expanded, including humans, show an excess of deleterious mutations. To test the predictions of our model, we analyse functional genetic diversity in humans and ﬁnd patterns that are consistent with our model.},

Within Europe, the ﬁrst axis of variation (PC1) was interpreted as evidence for the demic diffusion model of agriculture, in which farmers expanded from the Near East ;10,000 years ago and replaced the resident hunter-gatherer populations with little or no interbreeding. These interpretations of the PC maps have been recently questioned as the original results can be reproduced under models of spatially covarying allele frequencies without any expansion. Here, we study PC maps for data simulated under models of range expansion and admixture. Our simulations include a spatially realistic model of Neolithic farmer expansion and assume various levels of interbreeding between farmer and resident hunter-gatherer populations. An important result is that under a broad range of conditions, the gradients in PC1 maps are oriented along a direction perpendicular to the axis of the expansion, rather than along the same axis as the expansion. We propose that this surprising pattern is an outcome of the ‘‘allele surﬁng’’ phenomenon, which creates sectors of high allele-frequency differentiation that align perpendicular to the direction of the expansion.},

We analyzed the genealogy of more than one million individuals resulting from a range expansion in Quebec between 1686 and 1960 and reconstructed the spatial dynamics of the expansion. We find that a majority of the present Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean population can be traced back to ancestors having lived directly on or close to the wave front. Ancestors located on the front contributed significantly more to the current gene pool than those from the range core, likely due to a 20\% larger effective fertility of women on the wave front. This fitness component is heritable on the wave front and not in the core, implying that this life-history trait evolves during range expansions.},

	abstract = {Although genetic studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of the colonization of Near and Remote Oceania, important gaps still exist. One such gap is the Solomon Islands, which extend between Bougainville and Vanuatu, thereby bridging Near and Remote Oceania, and include both Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking groups. Here, we describe patterns of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nonrecombining Y chromosome (NRY) variation in over 700 individuals from 18 populations in the Solomons, including 11 Austronesian-speaking groups, 3 Papuan-speaking groups, and 4 Polynesian Outliers (descended via back migration from Polynesia). We ﬁnd evidence for ancient (pre-Lapita) colonization of the Solomons in old NRY paragroups as well as from M2-M353, which probably arose in the Solomons ;9,200 years ago and is the most frequent NRY haplogroup there. There are no consistent genetic differences between Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking groups, suggesting extensive genetic contact between them. Santa Cruz, which is located in Remote Oceania, shows unusually low frequencies of mtDNA and NRY haplogroups of recent Asian ancestry. This is in apparent contradiction with expectations based on archaeological and linguistic evidence for an early (;3,200 years ago), direct colonization of Santa Cruz by Lapita people from the Bismarck Archipelago, via a migration that ‘‘leapfrogged’’ over the rest of the Solomons. Polynesian Outliers show dramatic island-speciﬁc founder events involving various NRY haplogroups. We also ﬁnd that NRY, but not mtDNA, genetic distance is correlated with the geographic distance between Solomons groups and that historically attested spheres of cultural interaction are associated with the recent genetic structure of Solomons groups, as revealed by mtDNA HV1 sequence and Y-STR haplotype diversity. Our results ﬁll an important lacuna in human genetic studies of Oceania and aid in understanding the colonization and genetic history of this region.},

We have investigated the capacity of six minisatellites to discriminate between four populations in Oceania. We find that in comparison to Melanesians, Polynesians have a significant loss of heterozygosity (or gene diversity), not noted using more traditional markers. We show also that the number of alleles, the allele distribution and the mutation rates at the Polynesian minisatellite loci do not deviate from those predicted by the neutral mutation/infinite allele model. The low gene diversity is therefore likely to be a result of the maintenance of small population sizes and bottleneck effects during the colonization of the Pacific.},

The effectiveness of these communications depends in part on how well the presented terminology is understood. In qualitative interviews, we examined how US residents interpreted key terms drawn from IPCC reports, including tipping point, unprecedented transition, carbon neutral, carbon dioxide removal, adaptation, mitigation, sustainable development, and abrupt change. We recruited twenty participants with diverse views on climate change from a nationally representative sample. We identified common themes and misunderstandings. Overall, 88\% of the themes arose by the tenth interview, and no new themes arose after the seventeenth interview. Mitigation, carbon neutral, and unprecedented transition were perceived as the most difficult to understand. Adaptation and abrupt change were perceived as the easiest to understand. However, even if a term appeared to be understood, participants were not always clear about how it applied to climate change. Participants tended to draw on their mental models of non-climate contexts where terms had different meanings. Reading the terms in the context of sentences taken from communication materials was not always helpful due to the use of complex language.},

We distinguish between personal threat and planetary threat and we find that both threats have substantive effects on climate change concern, with personal threat exerting a greater influence on climate change concern than planetary threat. The effects of both types of threats are also moderated by Gross Domestic Product per capita, such that threats have stronger effects on climate change concern in high-income countries than in low-income countries. Our findings contribute to the existing literature and open up new debates concerning the role of threats in climate change concern and have implications for climate change communication.},

Methods:  A three-tiered approach was used, consisting of a bibliometric analysis, an online survey and a set of case studies, which allow a profile to be built, as to how a sample of universities from 45 countries handle climate change as part of their teaching programs.
Results:  This paper reports on a study which aimed at identifying the extent to which matters related to climate change are addressed within the teaching and research practices at universities, with a focus on the training needs of teaching staff. It consists of a bibliometric analysis, combined with an online worldwide survey aimed at ascertaining the degree of involvement from universities in reducing their own carbon footprint, and the ways they offer training provisions on the topic. This is complemented by a set of 12 case studies from universities round the world, illustrat‑ing current trends on how universities handle climate change. Apart from reporting on the outcomes of the study, the paper highlights what some universities are doing to handle climate issues, and discusses the implications of the research.
Conclusions:  The paper lists some items via which universities may better educate and train their students on how to handle the many challenges posed by climate change.},

Here, we take a first step in understanding the material outcomes of these efforts. Specifically, we provide an overview of climate-related activism as a form of civic engagement, paying particular attention to the targets of this activism and its environmental outcomes in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Then, we focus on one of the most common tactics to gain momentum in recent years: the school strike, which has mobilized a growing number of participants around the world. We discuss how the Coronavirus pandemic has changed the climate movement with much activism moving online. We conclude by discussing the overall state of the knowledge about the outcomes of climate activism, as well as highlighting the need for careful research to measure its effects across scale.},

Many complex features are often assumed to be more functional or adaptive than their simpler alternatives. However, in 1999, Arlin Stolzfus published a paper in the Journal of Molecular Evolution that outlined a framework in which complexity can arise through a series of non-adaptive steps. He called this framework Constructive Neutral Evolution (CNE). Despite its two-decade-old roots, many evolutionary biologists still appear to be unaware of this explanatory framework for the origins of complexity. In this perspective piece, we explain the theory of CNE and how it changes the order of events in narratives that describe the evolution of complexity. We also provide an extensive list of cellular features that may have become more complex through CNE. We end by discussing strategies to determine whether complexity arose through neutral or adaptive processes.},

	abstract = {We introduce a flexible and robust simulation-based framework to infer demographic parameters from the site frequency spectrum (SFS) computed on large genomic datasets. We show that our composite-likelihood approach allows one to study evolutionary models of arbitrary complexity, which cannot be tackled by other current likelihood-based methods. For simple scenarios, our approach compares favorably in terms of accuracy and speed with LaLi, the current reference in the field, while showing better convergence properties for complex models. We first apply our methodology to non-coding genomic SNP data from four human populations. To infer their demographic history, we compare neutral evolutionary models of increasing complexity, including unsampled populations. We further show the versatility of our framework by extending it to the inference of demographic parameters from SNP chips with known ascertainment, such as that recently released by Affymetrix to study human origins. Whereas previous ways of handling ascertained SNPs were either restricted to a single population or only allowed the inference of divergence time between a pair of populations, our framework can correctly infer parameters of more complex models including the divergence of several populations, bottlenecks and migration. We apply this approach to the reconstruction of African demography using two distinct ascertained human SNP panels studied under two evolutionary models. The two SNP panels lead to globally very similar estimates and confidence intervals, and suggest an ancient divergence (.110 Ky) between Yoruba and San populations. Our methodology appears well suited to the study of complex scenarios from large genomic data sets.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) is a surprisingly successful branch of machine learning. The success of DL is usually explained by focusing analysis on a particular recent algorithm and its traits. Instead, we propose that an explanation of the success of DL must look at the population of all algorithms in the ﬁeld and how they have evolved over time. We argue that cultural evolution is a useful framework to explain the success of DL. In analogy to biology, we use ‘development’ to mean the process converting the pseudocode or text description of an algorithm into a fully trained model. This includes writing the programming code, compiling and running the program, and training the model. If all parts of the process don’t align well then the resultant model will be useless (if the code runs at all!). This is a constraint. A core component of evolutionary developmental biology is the concept of deconstraints –these are modiﬁcation to the developmental process that avoid complete failure by automatically accommodating changes in other components. We suggest that many important innovations in DL, from neural networks themselves to hyperparameter optimization and AutoGrad, can be seen as developmental deconstraints. These deconstraints can be very helpful to both the particular algorithm in how it handles challenges in implementation and the overall ﬁeld of DL in how easy it is for new ideas to be generated. We highlight how our perspective can both advance DL and lead to new insights for evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {Using mitochondrial lineage analysis of 1,178 individuals from Polynesia, the western Pacific, and Taiwan, we show that the major prehistoric settlement of Polynesia was from the west and involved two or possibly three genetically distinct populations. The predominant lineage group, accounting for 94\% of Polynesian mtDNA, shares a 9-bp COII/tRNALYS intergenic deletion and characteristic control region transition variants, compared to the Cambridge reference sequence. In Polynesia, the diversity of this group is extremely restricted, while related lineages in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan are increasingly diverse. This suggests a relatively recent major eastward expansion into Polynesia, perhaps originating from Taiwan, in agreement with archaeological and linguistic evidence, but which experienced one or more severe population bottlenecks. The second mitochondrial lineage group, accounting for 3.5\% of Polynesian mtDNA haplotypes, does not have the 9-bp deletion and is characterized by an A-C transversional variant at nt position 16265. Specific oligonucleotides for this variant were used to select individuals from the population sample who, with other sequences, show that the Polynesian lineages were part of a diverse group in Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. The very low overall diversity of both lineage groups in Polynesia suggests there was severe population restriction during the colonization of remote Oceania. A third group, represented by only four individuals (0.6\%) in Polynesia but also present in the Philippines, shares variants at nt positions 16172 and 16304. Two Polynesians had unrelated haplotypes matching published sequences from native South Americans, which may be the first genetic evidence of prehistoric human contact between Polynesia and South America.},

A total of 1,037 individuals from 12 populations were screened for a 9-bp deletion in the intergenic region between the COil and tRNALYS genes that approaches fixation in Polynesians. Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes that identify specific mtDNA control region nucleotide substitutions were used to describe variation in individuals with the 9-bp deletion. The 9-bp deletion was not observed in northern Indians, Bangladeshis, or Pakistanis but was seen at low to moderate frequencies in the nine other Southeast Asian populations. Three substitutions in the control region at positions 16217, 16247, and 16261 have previously been observed at high frequency in Polynesian mtDNAs; this "Polynesian motif" was observed in 20\% of east Indonesians with the 9-bp deletion but was observed in only one additional individual. mtDNA types related to the Polynesian motif are highest in frequency in the corridor from Taiwan south through the Philippines and east Indonesia, and the highest diversity for these types is in Taiwan. These results are consistent with linguistic evidence of a Taiwanese origin for the proto-Polynesian expansion, which spread throughout Oceania by way of Indonesia.},

The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.},

Climate change also challenges many people’s worldview because any climate mitigation regime will have economic and political implications that are incompatible with libertarian ideals of unregulated free markets. These political implications have created an environment of rhetorical adversity in which disinformation abounds, thus compounding the challenges for climate communicators. The existing literature on how to communicate climate change and dispel misinformation converges on several conclusions: First, providing information about climate change, in particular explanations of why it occurs, can enhance people’s acceptance of science. Second, highlighting the scientific consensus can be an effective means to counter misinformation and raise public acceptance. Third, culturally aligned messages and messengers are more likely to be successful. Finally, climate misinformation is best defanged, through a process known as inoculation, before it is encountered, although debunking techniques can also be successful.},

Here we consider a broad range of individual lifestyle choices and calculate their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, based on 148 scenarios from 39 sources. We recommend four widely applicable high-impact (i.e. low emissions) actions with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions: having one fewer child (an average for developed countries of 58.6 tonnes CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year), living car-free (2.4 tCO2e saved per year), avoiding airplane travel (1.6 tCO2e saved per roundtrip transatlantic ﬂight) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e saved per year). These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household lightbulbs (eight times less). Though adolescents poised to establish lifelong patterns are an important target group for promoting high-impact actions, we ﬁnd that ten high school science textbooks from Canada largely fail to mention these actions (they account for 4\% of their recommended actions), instead focusing on incremental changes with much smaller potential emissions reductions. Government resources on climate change from the EU, USA, Canada, and Australia also focus recommendations on lower-impact actions. We conclude that there are opportunities to improve existing educational and communication structures to promote the most effective emission-reduction strategies and close this mitigation gap.},

Relevant literature is briefly reviewed on student and teacher understandings of climate change and conceptions of climate change education as education for preparing students for future climate change mitigation and adaptation measures and the potential for disaster. Opportunities in Australian schools for teaching climate change mitigation and adaptation are critically examined. Climate change should be understood as a complex social as well as scientific issue characterized by uncertain and context-specific knowledge. This demands educators engage in inquiry and co-learning with students. The lack of time and the reported curriculum opportunities to address climate change in the classroom suggest a need for using co-curricular and community initiatives for student investigations and learning. Teachers must encourage students to think critically and creatively about approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation and develop their capacity to respond with meaningful actions.},

	abstract = {Although experiments show that exposure to factual information can increase factual accuracy, the public remains stubbornly misinformed about many issues. Why do misperceptions persist even when factual interventions generally succeed at increasing the accuracy of people’s beliefs? We seek to answer this question by testing the role of information exposure and decay effects in a four-wave panel experiment (
              n
              = 2,898 at wave 4) in which we randomize the media content that people in the United States see about climate change. Our results indicate that science coverage of climate change increases belief accuracy and support for government action immediately after exposure, including among Republicans and people who reject anthropogenic climate change. However, both effects decay over time and can be attenuated by exposure to skeptical opinion content (but not issue coverage featuring partisan conflict). These findings demonstrate that the increases in belief accuracy generated by science coverage are short lived and can be neutralized by skeptical opinion content.},

            Numerous empirical studies in population genetics have used a summary statistic called the sample frequency spectrum (SFS), which summarizes the information in a sample of DNA sequences. Despite their popularity, the accuracy of inference methods based on the SFS is difficult to characterize theoretically, and it is currently unknown how the estimation accuracy improves as more sites in the genome are used. Here, we establish information theoretic limits on the accuracy of all estimators that use the SFS to infer population size histories. We study the rate of convergence to the true answer as the amount of data increases, and obtain the surprising result that it is exponentially worse than known convergence rates for many classical estimation problems in statistics.

              The sample frequency spectrum (SFS) of DNA sequences from a collection of individuals is a summary statistic that is commonly used for parametric inference in population genetics. Despite the popularity of SFS-based inference methods, little is currently known about the information theoretic limit on the estimation accuracy as a function of sample size. Here, we show that using the SFS to estimate the size history of a population has a minimax error of at least
              O
              (1/log
              s
              ), where
              s
              is the number of independent segregating sites used in the analysis. This rate is exponentially worse than known convergence rates for many classical estimation problems in statistics. Another surprising aspect of our theoretical bound is that it does not depend on the dimension of the SFS, which is related to the number of sampled individuals. This means that, for a fixed number
              s
              of segregating sites considered, using more individuals does not help to reduce the minimax error bound. Our result pertains to populations that have experienced a bottleneck, and we argue that it can be expected to apply to many populations in nature.},

We sequenced 518 whole genomes from altitudinal transects and found many regions differentiated between highland ({\textasciitilde} 1200 m) and lowland ({\textasciitilde} 200 m) populations. We show repeated genetic differentiation across replicate populations within species, including allopatric comparisons. In contrast, there is little molecular parallelism between the two species. By sampling five close relatives, we find that a large proportion of divergent regions identified within species have arisen from standing variation and putative adaptive introgression from high-altitude specialist species. Taken together our study supports a role for both standing genetic variation and gene flow from independently adapted species in promoting parallel local adaptation to the environment.},

Yet our understanding of the prevalence and distribution of founder events in humans and other species remains incomplete, as most existing methods require large sample sizes or phased genomes. Thus, we developed
              ASCEND
              that measures the correlation in allele sharing between pairs of individuals across the genome to infer the age and strength of founder events. We show that
              ASCEND
              can reliably estimate the parameters of founder events under a range of demographic scenarios. We then apply
              ASCEND
              to two species with contrasting evolutionary histories: {\textasciitilde}460 worldwide human populations and {\textasciitilde}40 modern dog breeds. In humans, we find that over half of the analyzed populations have evidence for recent founder events, associated with geographic isolation, modes of sustenance, or cultural practices such as endogamy. Notably, island populations have lower population sizes than continental groups and most hunter-gatherer, nomadic and indigenous groups have evidence of recent founder events. Many present-day groups––including Native Americans, Oceanians and South Asians––have experienced more extreme founder events than Ashkenazi Jews who have high rates of recessive diseases due their known history of founder events. Using ancient genomes, we show that the strength of founder events differs markedly across geographic regions and time––with three major founder events related to the peopling of Americas and a trend in decreasing strength of founder events in Europe following the Neolithic transition and steppe migrations. In dogs, we estimate extreme founder events in most breeds that occurred in the last 25 generations, concordant with the establishment of many dog breeds during the Victorian times. Our analysis highlights a widespread history of founder events in humans and dogs and elucidates some of the demographic and cultural practices related to these events.},

          Abstract
          Individuals sharing recent ancestors are likely to co-inherit large identical-by-descent (IBD) genomic regions. The distribution of these IBD segments in a population may be used to reconstruct past demographic events such as effective population size variation, but accurate IBD detection is difficult in ancient DNA (aDNA) data and in underrepresented populations with limited reference data. In this work, we introduce an accurate method for inferring effective population size variation during the past {\textasciitilde}2,000 years in both modern and aDNA data, called HapNe. HapNe infers recent population size fluctuations using either IBD sharing (HapNe-IBD) or linkage disequilibrium (HapNe-LD), which does not require phasing and can be computed in low coverage data, including data sets with heterogeneous sampling times. HapNe showed improved accuracy in a range of simulated demographic scenarios compared to currently available methods for IBD-based and LD-based inference of recent effective population size, while requiring fewer computational resources. We applied HapNe to several modern populations from the 1, 000 Genomes Project, the UK Biobank, the Allen Ancient DNA Resource, and recently published samples from Iron Age Britain, detecting multiple instances of recent effective population size variation across these groups.},

However, in data sets composed of individuals from diverse ancestries, HWE can be violated even without genotyping error, complicating the use of HWE testing to assess genotype data quality. In this manuscript, we present the Robust Uniﬁed Test for HWE (RUTH) to test for HWE while accounting for population structure and genotype uncertainty, and to evaluate the impact of population heterogeneity and genotype uncertainty on the standard HWE tests and alternative methods using simulated and real sequence data sets. Our results demonstrate that ignoring population structure or genotype uncertainty in HWE tests can inﬂate false-positive rates by many orders of magnitude. Our evaluations demonstrate different tradeoffs between false positives and statistical power across the methods, with RUTH consistently among the best across all evaluations. RUTH is implemented as a practical and scalable software tool to rapidly perform HWE tests across millions of markers and hundreds of thousands of individuals while supporting standard VCF/BCF formats.

During this particular phase, the SPCZ is closer to Tahiti and induces positive large-scale precipitation. On interannual time scales, more frequent and strong El Niño events favour a northward SPCZ migration. This northern position causes a surface flux over Tahiti Island, which forces orographic precipitation on the windward side.

However, the majority of ancient genomes are of lower coverage and cannot be directly built into genealogies. Here, we present a fast and scalable method, Colate, the ﬁrst approach for inferring ancestral relationships through time between low-coverage genomes without requiring phasing or imputation. Our approach leverages sharing patterns of mutations dated using a genealogy to infer coalescence rates. For deeply sequenced ancient genomes, we additionally introduce an extension of the Relate algorithm for joint inference of genealogies incorporating such genomes. Application to 278 present-day and 430 ancient DNA samples of {\textgreater}0.5x mean coverage allows us to identify dynamic population structure and directional gene ﬂow between early farmer and European hunter-gatherer groups. We further show that the previously reported, but still unexplained, increase in the TCC/TTC mutation rate, which is strongest in West Eurasia today, was already present at similar strength and widespread in the Late Glacial Period {\textasciitilde}10kÀ15k years ago, but is not observed in samples {\textgreater}30k years old. It is strongest in Neolithic farmers, and highly correlated with recent coalescence rates between other genomes and a 10,000year-old Anatolian hunter-gatherer. This suggests gene-ﬂow among ancient peoples postdating the last glacial maximum as widespread and localizes the driver of this mutational signal in both time and geography in that region.

	abstract = {The estimation of genetic clusters using genomic data has application from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to demographic history to polygenic risk scores (PRS) and is expected to play an important role in the analyses of increasingly diverse, large-scale cohorts. However, existing methods are computationally-intensive, prohibitively so in the case of nationwide biobanks. Here we explore Archetypal Analysis as an efficient, unsupervised approach for identifying genetic clusters and for associating individuals with them. Such unsupervised approaches help avoid conflating socially constructed ethnic labels with genetic clusters by eliminating the need for exogenous training labels. We show that Archetypal Analysis yields similar cluster structure to existing unsupervised methods such as ADMIXTURE and provides interpretative advantages. More importantly, we show that since Archetypal Analysis can be used with lower-dimensional representations of genetic data, significant reductions in computational time and memory requirements are possible. When Archetypal Analysis is run in such a fashion, it takes several orders of magnitude less compute time than the current standard, ADMIXTURE. Finally, we demonstrate uses ranging across datasets from humans to canids.},

	abstract = {Integrating datasets from different disciplines is hard because the data are often qualitatively different in meaning, scale and reliability. When two datasets describe the same entities, many scientific questions can be phrased around whether the (dis)similarities between entities are conserved across such different data. Our method, CLARITY, quantifies consistency across datasets, identifies where inconsistencies arise and aids in their interpretation. We illustrate this using three diverse comparisons: gene methylation versus expression, evolution of language sounds versus word use, and country-level economic metrics versus cultural beliefs. The non-parametric approach is robust to noise and differences in scaling, and makes only weak assumptions about how the data were generated. It operates by decomposing similarities into two components: a ‘structural’ component analogous to a clustering, and an underlying ‘relationship’ between those structures. This allows a ‘structural comparison’ between two similarity matrices using their predictability from ‘structure’. Significance is assessed with the help of re-sampling appropriate for each dataset.

Unlike previous methods, which employ the Sequentially Markov Coalescent approximation, ARGinfer uses the Coalescent with Recombination, allowing more accurate inference of key evolutionary parameters. We show using simulations that ARGinfer can accurately estimate many properties of the evolutionary history of the sample, including the topology and branch lengths of the genealogical tree at each sequence site, and the times and locations of mutation and recombination events. ARGinfer approximates posterior probability distributions for these and other quantities, providing interpretable assessments of uncertainty that we show to be well calibrated.

	abstract = {The complex correlation structure of a collection of orthologous DNA sequences is uniquely captured by the ‘‘ancestral recombination graph’’ (ARG), a complete record of coalescence and recombination events in the history of the sample. However, existing methods for ARG inference are computationally intensive, highly approximate, or limited to small numbers of sequences, and, as a consequence, explicit ARG inference is rarely used in applied population genomics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm for ARG inference that is efficient enough to apply to dozens of complete mammalian genomes. The key idea of our approach is to sample an ARG of n chromosomes conditional on an ARG of n\{\vphantom{\}}1 chromosomes, an operation we call ‘‘threading.’’ Using techniques based on hidden Markov models, we can perform this threading operation exactly, up to the assumptions of the sequentially Markov coalescent and a discretization of time. An extension allows for threading of subtrees instead of individual sequences. Repeated application of these threading operations results in highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for ARGs. We have implemented these methods in a computer program called ARGweaver. Experiments with simulated data indicate that ARGweaver converges rapidly to the posterior distribution over ARGs and is effective in recovering various features of the ARG for dozens of sequences generated under realistic parameters for human populations. In applications of ARGweaver to 54 human genome sequences from Complete Genomics, we find clear signatures of natural selection, including regions of unusually ancient ancestry associated with balancing selection and reductions in allele age in sites under directional selection. The patterns we observe near protein-coding genes are consistent with a primary influence from background selection rather than hitchhiking, although we cannot rule out a contribution from recurrent selective sweeps.},

	abstract = {The ancestral recombination graph is a structure that describes the joint genealogies of sampled DNA sequences along the genome. Recent computational methods have made impressive progress toward scalably estimating whole-genome genealogies. In addition to inferring the ancestral recombination graph, some of these methods can also provide ancestral recombination graphs sampled from a deﬁned posterior distribution. Obtaining good samples of ancestral recombination graphs is crucial for quantifying statistical uncertainty and for estimating population genetic parameters such as effective population size, mutation rate, and allele age. Here, we use standard neutral coalescent simulations to benchmark the estimates of pairwise coalescence times from 3 popular ancestral recombination graph inference programs: ARGweaver, Relate, and tsinferþtsdate. We compare (1) the true coalescence times to the inferred times at each locus; (2) the distribution of coalescence times across all loci to the expected exponential distribution; (3) whether the sampled coalescence times have the properties expected of a valid posterior distribution. We ﬁnd that inferred coalescence times at each locus are most accurate in ARGweaver, and often more accurate in Relate than in tsinferþtsdate. However, all 3 methods tend to overestimate small coalescence times and underestimate large ones. Lastly, the posterior distribution of ARGweaver is closer to the expected posterior distribution than Relate’s, but this higher accuracy comes at a substantial trade-off in scalability. The best choice of method will depend on the number and length of input sequences and on the goal of downstream analyses, and we provide guidelines for the best practices.},

This signature has been formalized in statistical tests for HGF detection and used for example to detect massive adaptive gene flows in malaria vectors or to order evolutionary events involved in eukaryogenesis. However, these studies rely on the assumption that ghost lineages (all unsampled extant and extinct taxa) have little influence. We demonstrate here with simulations and data reanalysis that when considering the more realistic condition that unsampled taxa are legion compared to sampled ones, the conclusion of these studies become unfounded or even reversed.

            Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate analysis that reduces the complexity of datasets while preserving data covariance. The outcome can be visualized on colorful scatterplots, ideally with only a minimal loss of information. PCA applications, implemented in well-cited packages like EIGENSOFT and PLINK, are extensively used as the foremost analyses in population genetics and related fields (e.g., animal and plant or medical genetics). PCA outcomes are used to shape study design, identify, and characterize individuals and populations, and draw historical and ethnobiological conclusions on origins, evolution, dispersion, and relatedness. The replicability crisis in science has prompted us to evaluate whether PCA results are reliable, robust, and replicable. We analyzed twelve common test cases using an intuitive color-based model alongside human population data. We demonstrate that PCA results can be artifacts of the data and can be easily manipulated to generate desired outcomes. PCA adjustment also yielded unfavorable outcomes in association studies. PCA results may not be reliable, robust, or replicable as the field assumes. Our findings raise concerns about the validity of results reported in the population genetics literature and related fields that place a disproportionate reliance upon PCA outcomes and the insights derived from them. We conclude that PCA may have a biasing role in genetic investigations and that 32,000-216,000 genetic studies should be reevaluated. An alternative mixed-admixture population genetic model is discussed.},

Together with the recently described Homo luzonensis, we suggest that there were multiple archaic species that inhabited the Philippines prior to the arrival of modern humans and that these archaic groups may have been genetically related. Altogether, our ﬁndings unveil a complex intertwined history of modern and archaic humans in the Asia-Paciﬁc region, where distinct Islander Denisovan populations differentially admixed with incoming Australasians across multiple locations and at various points in time.},

Although the spatial arrangement of populations can lead to intricate migration networks, theoretical developments have focused mainly on a small subset of such networks, emphasizing the island-migration and stepping-stone models. In this study, we investigate all small network motifs: the set of all possible migration networks among populations subdivided into at most four subpopulations. For each motif, we use coalescent theory to derive expectations for three quantities that describe genetic variation: nucleotide diversity, FST, and half-time to equilibrium diversity. We describe the impact of network properties on these quantities, ﬁnding that motifs with a high mean node degree have the largest nucleotide diversity and the longest time to equilibrium, whereas motifs with low density have the largest FST. In addition, we show that the motifs whose pattern of variation is most strongly inﬂuenced by loss of a connection or a subpopulation are those that can be split easily into disconnected components. We illustrate our results using two example data sets—sky island birds of genus Sholicola and Indian tigers—identifying disturbance scenarios that produce the greatest reduction in genetic diversity; for tigers, we also compare the beneﬁts of two assisted gene ﬂow scenarios. Our results have consequences for understanding the effect of geography on genetic diversity, and they can assist in designing strategies to alter population migration networks toward maximizing genetic variation in the context of conservation of endangered species.},

We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify ﬁne-scale variation in recombination rate from population data. We also outline how the model could be useful in other contexts, such as in the development of more efﬁcient haplotype-based methods for LD mapping.},

	abstract = {As a genetic mutation is passed down across generations, it distinguishes those genomes that have inherited it from those that have not, providing a glimpse of the genealogical tree relating the genomes to each other at that site. Statistical summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to deﬁne a general framework that efﬁciently computes single-site population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general approach accumulates sample weights within the genealogical tree at each position on the genome, which are then combined using a summary function; different statistics result from different choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in three ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated as usual from genome sequence; by branch, which gives the expected value of the dual site statistic under the inﬁnite sites model of mutation, and by node, which summarizes the contribution of each ancestor to these statistics. We use the framework to implement many currently deﬁned statistics of genome sequence (making the statistics’ relationship to the underlying genealogical trees concrete and explicit), as well as the corresponding branch statistics of tree shape. We evaluate computational performance using simulated data, and show that calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general framework is several orders of magnitude more efﬁcient than optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project data set, and discuss ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological signals.},

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the current evidence on the safety and efﬁcacy of CBD in anxiety and anxiety-related disorders. Data sources: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from database inception through June 2019. A bibliographic search of relevant articles was also conducted. Study selection: Articles published from case reports, case series, or randomized controlled trials on human subjects were included in the review if they examined the safety and efﬁcacy of CBD therapy in anxiety and anxiety-related disorders. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted the following data from the articles: year of publication; study design; patient characteristics (sex; type of anxiety disorder; use of concomitant anxiolytic therapy); dosing strategy and route of CBD administration; and safety and efﬁcacy outcomes.
Results: Eight articles were included in the review: 6 small, randomized controlled trials; 1 case series; and 1 case report. These studies examined the role of CBD in the anxiety response of healthy volunteers; in generalized anxiety disorder; in social anxiety disorder; and in the anxiety component of posttraumatic stress syndrome. No articles that evaluated CBD in panic disorder, speciﬁc phobia, separation anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder were identiﬁed. In the studies, CBD was administered orally as a capsule or as a sublingual spray and as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. Doses varied widely, with studies employing ﬁxed CBD doses ranging from 6 mg to 400 mg per dose. Various anxiety assessment scales were used in the studies to assess efﬁcacy, with CBD demonstrating improved clinical outcomes among the instruments. In general, CBD was well-tolerated and associated with minimal adverse effects, with the most commonly noted adverse effects being fatigue and sedation.
Conclusion: CBD has a promising role as alternative therapy in the management of anxiety disorders. However, more studies with standardized approaches to dosing and clinical outcome measurements are needed to determine the appropriate dosing strategy for CBD and its place in therapy.},

The estimate is used by population geneticists to characterize population structure, by ecologists to estimate migration rates, by animal breeders to describe genetic variation, and by forensic scientists to quantify the strength of matching DNA profiles. This review extends the work of Weir \& Cockerham by allowing different levels of coancestry for different populations, and by allowing non-zero coancestries between pairs of populations. All estimates are relative to the average value of θ between pairs of populations. Moment estimates for within- and between-population θ values are likely to have large sampling variances, although these may be reduced by combining information over loci. Variances also decrease with the numbers of alleles at a locus, and with the numbers of populations sampled. This review also extends the work of Weir \& Cockerham by employing maximum likelihood methods under the assumption that allele frequencies follow the normal distribution over populations. For the case of equal θ values within populations and zero θ values between populations, the maximum likelihood estimate is the same as that given by Robertson \& Hill in 1984 ( 70 ). The review concludes by relating functions of θ values to times of population divergence under a pure drift model.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the spatial and temporal structure of global island colonization allows us to frame the extent of insular human cultural diversity, model the impact of common environmental factors cross-culturally, and understand the contribution of island maritime societies to big historical processes. No such analysis has, however, been undertaken since the 1980s. In this paper we review and update global patterns in island colonization, synthesizing data from all the major island groups and theaters and undertaking quantitative and qualitative analysis of these data. We demonstrate the continued relevance of certain biogeographic and environmental factors in structuring how humans colonized islands during the Holocene. Our analysis also suggests the importance of other factors, some previously anticipated—such as culturally ingrained seafaring traditions and technological enhancement of dispersal capacity—but some not, such as the relationship between demographic growth and connectivity, differing trophic limitations impinging on colonizing farmers versus hunter-gatherer-foragers, and the constraining effects of latitude. We also connect colonization with continental dynamics: both the horizontal transmission of farming lifestyles earlier in the Holocene, and subsequent centrifugal processes associated with early state formation later in the Holocene.},

	abstract = {The application of genetic relationships among individuals, characterized by a genetic relationship matrix (GRM), has far-reaching effects in human genetics. However, the current standard to calculate the GRM treats linked markers as independent and does not explicitly model the underlying genealogical history of the study sample. Here, we propose a coalescent-informed framework, namely the expected GRM (eGRM), to infer the expected relatedness between pairs of individuals given an ancestral recombination graph (ARG) of the sample. Through extensive simulations, we show that the eGRM is an unbiased estimate of latent pairwise genome-wide relatedness and is robust when computed with ARG inferred from incomplete genetic data. As a result, the eGRM better captures the structure of a population than the canonical GRM, even when using the same genetic information. More importantly, our framework allows a principled approach to estimate the eGRM at different time depths of the ARG, thereby revealing the time-varying nature of population structure in a sample. When applied to SNP array genotypes from a population sample from Northern and Eastern Finland, we ﬁnd that clustering analysis with the eGRM reveals population structure driven by subpopulations that would not be apparent via the canonical GRM and that temporally the population model is consistent with recent divergence and expansion. Taken together, our proposed eGRM provides a robust tree-centric estimate of relatedness with wide application to genetic studies.},

	abstract = {Human populations have been shaped by catastrophes that may have left long-lasting signatures in their genomes. One notable example is the second plague pandemic that entered Europe in ca. 1,347 CE and repeatedly returned for over 300 years, with typical village and town mortality estimated at 10\%–40\%.1 It is assumed that this high mortality affected the gene pools of these populations. First, local population crashes reduced genetic diversity. Second, a change in frequency is expected for sequence variants that may have affected survival or susceptibility to the etiologic agent (Yersinia pestis).2 Third, mass mortality might alter the local gene pools through its impact on subsequent migration patterns. We explored these factors using the Norwegian city of Trondheim as a model, by sequencing 54 genomes spanning three time periods: (1) prior to the plague striking Trondheim in 1,349 CE, (2) the 17th–19th century, and (3) the present. We ﬁnd that the pandemic period shaped the gene pool by reducing long distance immigration, in particular from the British Isles, and inducing a bottleneck that reduced genetic diversity. Although we also observe an excess of large FST values at multiple loci in the genome, these are shaped by reference biases introduced by mapping our relatively low genome coverage degraded DNA to the reference genome. This implies that attempts to detect selection using ancient DNA (aDNA) datasets that vary by read length and depth of sequencing coverage may be particularly challenging until methods have been developed to account for the impact of differential reference bias on test statistics.},

	abstract = {Background: Historically, geneticists have relied on genotyping arrays and imputation to study human genetic variation. However, an underrepresentation of diverse populations has resulted in arrays that poorly capture global genetic variation, and a lack of reference panels. This has contributed to deepening global health disparities. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) better captures genetic variation but remains prohibitively expensive. Thus, we explored WGS at “mid-pass” 1-7x coverage.
Results: Here, we developed and benchmarked methods for mid-pass sequencing. When applied to a population without an existing genomic reference panel, 4x mid-pass performed consistently well across ethnicities, with highc recall (98\%) and precision (97.5\%).
Conclusion: Compared to array data imputed into 1000 Genomes, mid-pass performed better across all metrics and identified novel population-specific variants with potential disease relevance. We hope our work will reduce financial barriers for geneticists from underrepresented populations to characterize their genomes prior to biomedical genetic applications.},

	abstract = {Social movements are critical agents of social change, but are rarely monolithic. Instead, movements are often made up of distinct factions with unique agendas and tactics, and there is little scientific consensus on when these factions may complement—or impede—one another’s influence. One central debate concerns whether radical flanks within a movement increase support for more moderate factions within the same movement by making the moderate faction seem more reasonable—or reduce support for moderate factions by making the entire movement seem unreasonable. Results of two online experiments conducted with diverse samples (N = 2,772), including a study of the animal rights movement and a preregistered study of the climate movement, show that the presence of a radical flank increases support for a moderate faction within the same movement. Further, it is the use of radical tactics, such as property destruction or violence, rather than a radical agenda, that drives this effect. Results indicate the effect owes to a contrast effect: Use of radical tactics by one flank led the more moderate faction to appear less radical, even though all characteristics of the moderate faction were held constant. This perception led participants to identify more with and, in turn, express greater support for the more moderate faction. These results suggest that activist groups that employ unpopular tactics can increase support for other groups within the same movement, pointing to a hidden way in which movement factions are complementary, despite pursuing divergent approaches to social change.},

Due to the complex demographic history of Latin America and the lack of balanced representation of Native American genomes in current imputation panels, the discovery of locally relevant disease variants is likely to be missed, limiting the scope and impact of biomedical research in these populations. Therefore, the necessity of better diversity representation in genomic databases is a scientific imperative. Here, we expand the 1,000 Genomes reference panel (1KGP) with 134 Native American genomes (1KGP + NAT) to assess imputation performance in Latin American individuals of mixed ancestry. Our panel increased the number of SNPs above the GWAS quality threshold, thus improving statistical power for association studies in the region. It also increased imputation accuracy, particularly in low-frequency variants segregating in Native American ancestry tracts. The improvement is subtle but consistent across countries and proportional to the number of genomes added from local source populations. To project the potential improvement with a higher number of reference genomes, we performed simulations and found that at least 3,000 Native American genomes are needed to equal the imputation performance of variants in European ancestry tracts. This reflects the concerning imbalance of diversity in current references and highlights the contribution of our work to reducing it while complementing efforts to improve global equity in genomic research.},

	abstract = {Human history is written in both our genes and our languages. The extent to which our biological and linguistic histories are congruent has been the subject of considerable debate, with clear examples of both matches and mismatches. To disentangle the patterns of demographic and cultural transmission, we need a global systematic assessment of matches and mismatches. Here, we assemble a genomic database (GeLaTo, or Genes and Languages Together) specifically curated to investigate genetic and linguistic diversity worldwide. We find that most populations in GeLaTo that speak languages of the same language family (i.e., that descend from the same ancestor language) are also genetically highly similar. However, we also identify nearly 20\% mismatches in populations genetically close to linguistically unrelated groups. These mismatches, which occur within the time depth of known linguistic relatedness up to about 10,000 y, are scattered around the world, suggesting that they are a regular outcome in human history. Most mismatches result from populations shifting to the language of a neighboring population that is genetically different because of independent demographic histories. In line with the regularity of such shifts, we find that only half of the language families in GeLaTo are genetically more cohesive than expected under spatial autocorrelations. Moreover, the genetic and linguistic divergence times of population pairs match only rarely, with Indo-European standing out as the family with most matches in our sample. Together, our database and findings pave the way for systematically disentangling demographic and cultural history and for quantifying processes of shifts in language and social identities on a global scale.},

	abstract = {Unraveling the complex demographic histories of natural populations is a central problem in population genetics. Understanding past demographic events is of general anthropological interest, but is also an important step in establishing accurate null models when identifying adaptive or disease-associated genetic variation. An important class of tools for inferring past population size changes from genomic sequence data are Coalescent Hidden Markov Models (CHMMs). These models make efficient use of the linkage information in population genomic datasets by using the local genealogies relating sampled individuals as latent states that evolve along the chromosome in an HMM framework. Extending these models to large sample sizes is challenging, since the number of possible latent states increases rapidly. Here, we present our method CHIMP (CHMM History-Inference Maximum-Likelihood Procedure), a novel CHMM method for inferring the size history of a population. It can be applied to large samples (hundreds of haplotypes) and only requires unphased genomes as input. The two implementations of CHIMP that we present here use either the height of the genealogical tree (TMRCA) or the total branch length, respectively, as the latent variable at each position in the genome. The requisite transition and emission probabilities are obtained by numerically solving certain systems of differential equations derived from the ancestral process with recombination. The parameters of the population size history are subsequently inferred using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In addition, we implement a composite likelihood scheme to allow the method to scale to large sample sizes. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method in a variety of benchmark tests using simulated data and present comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our implementation using TMRCA as the latent variable shows comparable performance and provides accurate estimates of effective population sizes in intermediate and ancient times. Our method is agnostic to the phasing of the data, which makes it a promising alternative in scenarios where high quality data is not available, and has potential applications for pseudo-haploid data.},

	abstract = {The timing of the initial peopling of the Polynesian islands remains highly debated. Suggested dates are primarily based on archaeological evidence and differ by several hundred years. Ioannidis et al. [2021] used genome-wide data from 430 modern individuals from 21 Pacific islands to obtain genetic estimates. Their results supported late settlement dates, e.g. approximately 1200 CE for Rapa Nui. However, when investigating the underlying model we found that the genetic estimator used by Ioannidis et al. [2021] is biased to be about 300 years too old. Correcting for this bias gives genetic settlement dates that are more recent than any dates consistent with archaeological records, as radiocarbon dating of human-modified artifacts shows settlement definitively earlier than the bias-corrected genetic estimates. These too-recent estimates can only be explained by substantial gene flow between islands after their initial settlements. Therefore, contacts attested by archaeological and linguistic evidence [Kirch, 2021] must have been accompanied also by demographically significant movement of people. This gene flow well after the initial settlements was not modelled by Ioannidis et al. [2021] and challenges their interpretation that carving anthropomorphic stone statues was spread during initial settlements of islands. Instead, the distribution of this cultural practice likely reflects later inter-island exchanges, as suggested earlier [Kirch, 2017].},

	abstract = {The advent of genome-wide dense variation data provides an opportunity to investigate ancestry in unprecedented detail, but presents new statistical challenges. We propose a novel inference framework that aims to efficiently capture information on population structure provided by patterns of haplotype similarity. Each individual in a sample is considered in turn as a recipient, whose chromosomes are reconstructed using chunks of DNA donated by the other individuals. Results of this ‘‘chromosome painting’’ can be summarized as a ‘‘coancestry matrix,’’ which directly reveals key information about ancestral relationships among individuals. If markers are viewed as independent, we show that this matrix almost completely captures the information used by both standard Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and model-based approaches such as STRUCTURE in a unified manner. Furthermore, when markers are in linkage disequilibrium, the matrix combines information across successive markers to increase the ability to discern fine-scale population structure using PCA. In parallel, we have developed an efficient model-based approach to identify discrete populations using this matrix, which offers advantages over PCA in terms of interpretability and over existing clustering algorithms in terms of speed, number of separable populations, and sensitivity to subtle population structure. We analyse Human Genome Diversity Panel data for 938 individuals and 641,000 markers, and we identify 226 populations reflecting differences on continental, regional, local, and family scales. We present multiple lines of evidence that, while many methods capture similar information among strongly differentiated groups, more subtle population structure in human populations is consistently present at a much finer level than currently available geographic labels and is only captured by the haplotype-based approach.

Although classical and recent work have shown that studying admixture can yield novel historical insights, the extent to which this process contributed to adaptation remains underexplored. Here, we introduce a novel statistical model, speciﬁc to admixed populations, that identiﬁes loci under selection while determining whether the selection likely occurred post-admixture or prior to admixture in one of the ancestral source populations. Through extensive simulations, we show that this method is able to detect selection, even in recently formed admixed populations, and to accurately differentiate between selection occurring in the ancestral or admixed population. We apply this method to genome-wide SNP data of ∼4,000 individuals in ﬁve admixed Latin American cohorts from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Our approach replicates previous reports of selection in the human leukocyte antigen region that are consistent with selection post-admixture. We also report novel signals of selection in genomic regions spanning 47 genes, reinforcing many of these signals with an alternative, commonly used local-ancestry-inference approach. These signals include several genes involved in immunity, which may reﬂect responses to endemic pathogens of the Americas and to the challenge of infectious disease brought by European contact. In addition, some of the strongest signals inferred to be under selection in the Native American ancestral groups of modern Latin Americans overlap with genes implicated in energy metabolism phenotypes, plausibly reﬂecting adaptations to novel dietary sources available in the Americas.},

	abstract = {Admixture has been a pervasive phenomenon in human history, extensively shaping the patterns of population genetic diversity. There is increasing evidence to suggest that admixture can also facilitate genetic adaptation to local environments, i.e., admixed populations acquire beneﬁcial mutations from source populations, a process that we refer to as ‘‘adaptive admixture.’’ However, the role of adaptive admixture in human evolution and the power to detect it remain poorly characterized. Here, we use extensive computer simulations to evaluate the power of several neutrality statistics to detect natural selection in the admixed population, assuming multiple admixture scenarios. We show that statistics based on admixture proportions, Fadm and LAD, show high power to detect mutations that are beneﬁcial in the admixed population, whereas other statistics, including iHS and FST, falsely detect neutral mutations that have been selected in the source populations only. By combining Fadm and LAD into a single, powerful statistic, we scanned the genomes of 15 worldwide, admixed populations for signatures of adaptive admixture. We conﬁrm that lactase persistence and resistance to malaria have been under adaptive admixture in West Africans and in Malagasy, North Africans, and South Asians, respectively. Our approach also uncovers other cases of adaptive admixture, including APOL1 in Fulani nomads and PKN2 in East Indonesians, involved in resistance to infection and metabolism, respectively. Collectively, our study provides evidence that adaptive admixture has occurred in human populations whose genetic history is characterized by periods of isolation and spatial expansions resulting in increased gene ﬂow.},

However, the history of genetic relationships in a given population is a fixed, unobserved object, and so an alternative approach is to treat this network of relationships as a complex object we wish to learn about, by observing how genomes have been noisily passed down through it. This paper explores this point of view, showing how to translate questions about population genetic data into calculations with a Poisson process of mutations on all ancestral genomes. This method is applied to give a robust interpretation to the f4 statistic used to identify admixture, and to design a new statistic that measures covariances in mean times to most recent common ancestor between two pairs of sequences. The method more generally interprets population genetic statistics in terms of sums of specific functions over ancestral genomes, thereby providing concrete, broadly interpretable interpretations for these statistics. This provides a method for describing demographic history without simplified demographic models. More generally, it brings into focus the population pedigree, which is averaged over in model-based demographic inference.},

              INTRODUCTION
              The characterization of modern and ancient human genome sequences has revealed previously unknown features of our evolutionary past. As genome data generation continues to accelerate—through the sequencing of population-scale biobanks and ancient samples from around the world—so does the potential to generate an increasingly detailed understanding of how populations have evolved.
              However, such genomic datasets are highly heterogeneous. Samples from diverse times, geographic locations, and populations are processed, sequenced, and analyzed using a variety of techniques. The resulting datasets contain genuine variation but also complex patterns of missingness and error. This makes combining data challenging and hinders efforts to generate the most complete picture of human genomic variation.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              To address these challenges, we use the foundational notion that the ancestral relationships of all humans who have ever lived can be described by a single genealogy or tree sequence, so named because it encodes the sequence of trees that link individuals to one another at every point in the genome. This tree sequence of humanity is immensely complex, but estimates of the structure are a powerful means of integrating diverse datasets and gaining greater insights into human genetic diversity. In this work, we introduce statistical and computational methods to infer such a unified genealogy of modern and ancient samples, validate the methods through a mixture of computer simulation and analysis of empirical data, and apply the methods to reveal features of human diversity and evolution.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We present a unified tree sequence of 3601 modern and eight high-coverage ancient human genome sequences compiled from eight datasets. This structure is a lossless and compact representation of 27 million ancestral haplotype fragments and 231 million ancestral lineages linking genomes from these datasets back in time. The tree sequence also benefits from the use of an additional 3589 ancient samples compiled from more than 100 publications to constrain and date relationships.
              Using simulations and empirical analyses, we demonstrate the ability to recover relationships between individuals and populations as well as to identify descendants of ancient samples. We calculate the distribution of the time to most recent common ancestry between the 215 populations of the constituent datasets, revealing patterns consistent with substantial variation in historical population size and evidence of archaic admixture in modern humans.
              The tree sequence also offers insight into patterns of recurrent mutation and sequencing error in commonly used genetic datasets. We find pervasive signals of sequencing error as well as a small subset of variant sites that appear to be erroneous.
              Finally, we introduce an estimator of ancestor geographic location that recapitulates key features of human history. We observe signals of very deep ancestral lineages in Africa, the out-of-Africa event, and archaic introgression in Oceania. The method motivates improved spatiotemporal inference methods that will better elucidate the paths and timings of historic migrations.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              The profusion of genetic sequencing data creates challenges for integrating diverse data sources. Our results demonstrate that whole-genome genealogies provide a powerful platform for synthesizing genetic data and investigating human history and evolution.

            Historical records and genetic analyses indicate that Latin Americans trace their ancestry mainly to the intermixing (admixture) of Native Americans, Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans. Using novel haplotype-based methods, here we infer sub-continental ancestry in over 6,500 Latin Americans and evaluate the impact of regional ancestry variation on physical appearance. We find that Native American ancestry components in Latin Americans correspond geographically to the present-day genetic structure of Native groups, and that sources of non-Native ancestry, and admixture timings, match documented migratory flows. We also detect South/East Mediterranean ancestry across Latin America, probably stemming mostly from the clandestine colonial migration of Christian converts of non-European origin (Conversos). Furthermore, we find that ancestry related to highland (Central Andean) versus lowland (Mapuche) Natives is associated with variation in facial features, particularly nose morphology, and detect significant differences in allele frequencies between these groups at loci previously associated with nose morphology in this sample.},

	abstract = {Climate projections by the fossil fuel industry have never been assessed. On the basis of company records, we quantitatively evaluated all available global warming projections documented by—and in many cases modeled by—Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003. We find that most of their projections accurately forecast warming that is consistent with subsequent observations. Their projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models. Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp also correctly rejected the prospect of a coming ice age, accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected, and reasonably estimated the “carbon budget” for holding warming below 2°C. On each of these points, however, the company’s public statements about climate science contradicted its own scientific data.
          , 
            Insider knowledge
            
              For decades, some members of the fossil fuel industry tried to convince the public that a causative link between fossil fuel use and climate warming could not be made because the models used to project warming were too uncertain. Supran
              et al
              . show that one of those fossil fuel companies, ExxonMobil, had their own internal models that projected warming trajectories consistent with those forecast by the independent academic and government models. What they understood about climate models thus contradicted what they led the public to believe. —HJS
            
          , 
            ExxonMobil’s own climate models showed that fossil fuel use would cause climate warming.
          , 
            
              BACKGROUND
              In 2015, investigative journalists discovered internal company memos indicating that Exxon oil company has known since the late 1970s that its fossil fuel products could lead to global warming with “dramatic environmental effects before the year 2050.” Additional documents then emerged showing that the US oil and gas industry’s largest trade association had likewise known since at least the 1950s, as had the coal industry since at least the 1960s, and electric utilities, Total oil company, and GM and Ford motor companies since at least the 1970s. Scholars and journalists have analyzed the texts contained in these documents, providing qualitative accounts of fossil fuel interests’ knowledge of climate science and its implications. In 2017, for instance, we demonstrated that Exxon’s internal documents, as well as peer-reviewed studies published by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists, overwhelmingly acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused. By contrast, the majority of Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp’s public communications promoted doubt on the matter.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              Many of the uncovered fossil fuel industry documents include explicit projections of the amount of warming expected to occur over time in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Yet, these numerical and graphical data have received little attention. Indeed, no one has systematically reviewed climate modeling projections by any fossil fuel interest. What exactly did oil and gas companies know, and how accurate did their knowledge prove to be? Here, we address these questions by reporting and analyzing all known global warming projections documented by—and in many cases modeled by—Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003.
              Our results show that in private and academic circles since the late 1970s and early 1980s, ExxonMobil predicted global warming correctly and skillfully. Using established statistical techniques, we find that 63 to 83\% of the climate projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming. ExxonMobil’s average projected warming was 0.20° ± 0.04°C per decade, which is, within uncertainty, the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007. The average “skill score” and level of uncertainty of ExxonMobil’s climate models (67 to 75\% and ±21\%, respectively) were also similar to those of the independent models.
              
                Moreover, we show that ExxonMobil scientists correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age in favor of a “carbon dioxide induced ‘super-interglacial’”; accurately predicted that human-caused global warming would first be detectable in the year 2000 ± 5; and reasonably estimated how much CO
                2
                would lead to dangerous warming.
              
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              Today, dozens of cities, counties, and states are suing oil and gas companies for their “longstanding internal scientific knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change and public deception campaigns.” The European Parliament and the US Congress have held hearings, US President Joe Biden has committed to holding fossil fuel companies accountable, and a grassroots social movement has arisen under the moniker \#ExxonKnew. Our findings demonstrate that ExxonMobil didn’t just know “something” about global warming decades ago—they knew as much as academic and government scientists knew. But whereas those scientists worked to communicate what they knew, ExxonMobil worked to deny it—including overemphasizing uncertainties, denigrating climate models, mythologizing global cooling, feigning ignorance about the discernibility of human-caused warming, and staying silent about the possibility of stranded fossil fuel assets in a carbon-constrained world.

            Motivation
            Structure methods are highly used population genetic methods for classifying individuals in a sample fractionally into discrete ancestry components.
          
          
            Contribution
            We introduce a new optimization algorithm of the classical Structure model in a maximum likelihood framework. Using analyses of real data we show that the new optimization algorithm finds higher likelihood values than the state-of-the-art method in the same computational time. We also present a new method for estimating population trees from ancestry components using a Gaussian approximation. Using coalescence simulations modeling populations evolving in a tree-like fashion, we explore the adequacy of the Structure model and the Gaussian assumption for identifying ancestry components correctly and for inferring the correct tree. In most cases, ancestry components are inferred correctly, although sample sizes and times since admixture can influence the inferences. Similarly, the popular Gaussian approximation tends to perform poorly when branch lengths are long, although the tree topology is correctly inferred in all scenarios explored. The new methods are implemented together with appropriate visualization tools in the computer package Ohana.

The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype.

To date, few GWAS have examined the genetic architecture of lipids in Polynesians, and none have in Samoans, whose unique population history, including many population bottlenecks, may provide insight into the biological foundations of variation in lipid levels. Here we performed a GWAS of four fasting serum lipid levels: total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TG) in a sample of 2849 Samoans, with validation genotyping for associations in a replication cohort comprising 1798 Samoans and American Samoans. We identiﬁed multiple genome-wide signiﬁcant associations (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8) previously seen in other populations—APOA1 with TG, CETP with HDL, and APOE with TC and LDL—and several suggestive associations (P {\textless} 1 × 10−5), including an association of variants downstream of MGAT1 and RAB21 with HDL. However, we observed different association signals for variants near APOE than what has been previously reported in non-Polynesian populations. The association with several known lipid loci combined with the newly identiﬁed associations with variants near MGAT1 and RAB21 suggest that while some of the genetic architecture of lipids is shared between Samoans and other populations, part of the genetic architecture may be Polynesian-speciﬁc.},

We generated genome-wide data from 164 ancient and 112 modern individuals. Analysis reveals five migratory streams into Micronesia.

People of the Mariana Archipelago may derive all of their precolonial ancestry from East Asian sources, making them the only Remote Oceanians without Papuan ancestry. Female-inherited mitochondrial DNA was highly differentiated across early Remote Oceanian communities but homogeneous within, implying matrilocal practices whereby women almost never raised their children in communities different from the ones in which they grew up.

	abstract = {It has become apparent from ancient DNA analysis, that the history of many human populations from across the globe are often complex, involving multiple population split, admixture, migration and isolation events. Local ancestry inference (LAI) aims to identify from which ancestral population chromosomal segments in admixed individuals are inherited. However, ancestry in existing LAI tools is characterised by a discrete population identity, a definition which is limited in the context of a complex demographic history involving multiple admixture events at different times. Moreover, many LAI tools rely on a reference panel of present day genomes that act as proxies for the ancestral populations. For ancient admixture events, these proxy genomes are likely only distantly related to the true ancestral populations. Here we present a new method that leverages advances in ancient DNA sequencing and genealogical inference to address these in issues in LAI. The method applies machine learning to tree sequences inferred for ancient and present day genomes and is based on a deterministic model of population structure, within which we introduce the concept of path ancestry. We show that the method is robust to a variety of demographic scenarios, generalises over model misspecification and that it outperforms a leading local ancestry inference tool. We further describe a downstream method to estimate the time since admixture for individuals with painted chromosomes. We apply the method to a large ancient DNA dataset covering Europe and West Eurasia and show that the inferred admixture ages are a better metric than sample ages alone for understanding movements of people across Europe in the past.},

CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become ﬁxed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection. Here we review the latest updates to CADD, including the most recent version, 1.4, which supports the human genome build GRCh38. We also present updates to our website that include simpliﬁed variant lookup, extended documentation, an Application Program Interface and improved mechanisms for integrating CADD scores into other tools or applications.

	abstract = {Gout is of particularly high prevalence in the Ma¯ ori and Pacific (Polynesian) populations of Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). Here, we investigated the contribution of common population-specific copy number variation (CNV) to gout in the Aotearoa NZ Polynesian population. Microarray-generated genome-wide genotype data from Aotearoa NZ Polynesian individuals with (n = 1196) and without (n = 1249) gout were analyzed. Comparator population groups were 552 individuals of European ancestry and 1962 of Han Chinese ancestry. Levels of circulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fifty-four CNV regions (CNVRs) appearing in at least 10 individuals were detected, of which seven common ({\textgreater}2\%) CNVRs were specific to or amplified in Polynesian people. A burden test of these seven revealed associations of insertion/deletion with gout (odds ratio (OR) 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.80 [1.01; 3.22], P = 0.046). Individually testing of the seven CNVRs for association with gout revealed nominal association of CNVR1 with gout in Western Polynesian (Chr6: 31.36–31.45 Mb, OR = 1.72 [1.03; 2.92], P = 0.04), CNVR6 in the meta-analyzed Polynesian sample sets (Chr1: 196.75–196.92 Mb, OR = 1.86 [1.16; 3.00], P = 0.01) and CNVR9 in Western Polynesian (Chr1: 189.35–189.54 Mb, OR = 2.75 [1.15; 7.13], P = 0.03). Analysis of European gout genetic association data demonstrated a signal of association at the CNVR1 locus that was an expression quantitative trait locus for MICA. The most common CNVR (CNVR1) includes deletion of the MICA gene, encoding an immunomodulatory protein. Expression of MICA was reduced in the serum of individuals with the deletion. In summary, we provide evidence for the association of CNVR1 containing MICA with gout in Polynesian people, implicating class I MHC-mediated antigen presentation in gout.},

Even though there is a growing consensus that Taiwan is the source of the spread of Austronesian languages, little is known about the migration patterns of the early Austronesians who settled in and left Taiwan, i.e. the “Into-Taiwan” and “out-of-Taiwan” events. In particular, the genetic diversity and structure within Taiwan and how this relates to the into-/out-of-Taiwan events are largely unexplored, primarily because most genomic studies have largely utilized data from just two of the 16 recognized Highland Austronesian groups in Taiwan. In this study, we generated the largest genome-wide data set of Taiwanese Austronesians to date, including six Highland groups and one Lowland group from across the island and two Taiwanese Han groups. We identified fine-scale genomic structure in Taiwan, inferred the ancestry profile of the ancestors of Austronesians, and found that the southern Taiwanese Austronesians show excess genetic affinities with the Austronesians outside of Taiwan. Our findings thus shed new light on the Into- and Out-of-Taiwan dispersals.},

              Genome-wide genealogies compactly represent the evolutionary history of a set of genomes and inferring them from genetic data has the potential to facilitate a wide range of analyses. We introduce a method, ARG-Needle, for accurately inferring biobank-scale genealogies from sequencing or genotyping array data, as well as strategies to utilize genealogies to perform association and other complex trait analyses. We use these methods to build genome-wide genealogies using genotyping data for 337,464 UK Biobank individuals and test for association across seven complex traits. Genealogy-based association detects more rare and ultra-rare signals (
              N

              r
               = 0.72) underlying sequencing variants enriched (4.8×) for loss-of-function variation. These results demonstrate that inferred genome-wide genealogies may be leveraged in the analysis of complex traits, complementing approaches that require the availability of large, population-specific sequencing panels.},

In 2022, there were several instances of attempts to damage or destroy high-value (cultural and economic) objects of art as a form of eco- or climate activism. In this article, it is argued that the destruction of, or attempts to destroy, any property is not a peaceful form of protest, and may constitute a criminal act. If unique art is destroyed through acts of violent climate activism, this can result in an irretrievable loss of socially important cultural icons. It might also induce a “boomerang effect”, i.e., the audience that such activists intend to alert might distance themselves from such actions. Such activists might also – through their destructive actions – land up irreversibly changing the culture of the appreciation of art by restricting the public’s access to artwork. Even though these acts garnered global attention, there are other productive non-destructive ways of drawing widespread attention to issues related to the environment, such as climate change, or energy policies, without harming humanity’s precious socio-cultural art.},

The fibroblasts of the patients do not respond to type I IFNs (IFN-α2, IFN-ω, or IFN-β). Remarkably, this IFNAR1 variant has a minor allele frequency \&gt;1\% in Samoa and is also observed in the Cook, Society, Marquesas, and Austral islands, as well as Fiji, whereas it is extremely rare or absent in the other populations tested, including those of the Pacific region.

We apply fastGLOBETROTTER to a cohort of more than 6000 Europeans from 10 countries, revealing previously unreported admixture signals. In particular, we infer multiple periods of admixture related to East Asian or Siberian-like sources, starting {\textgreater}2000 yr ago, in people living in countries north of the Baltic Sea. In contrast, we infer admixture related to West Asian, North African, and/or Southern European sources in populations south of the Baltic Sea, including admixture dated to ∼300–700 CE, overlapping the fall of the Roman Empire, in people from Belgium, France, and parts of Germany. Our new approach scales to analyzing hundreds to thousands of individuals from a putatively admixed population and, hence, is applicable to emerging large-scale cohorts of genetically homogeneous populations.},

	abstract = {Current policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase adaptation and mitigation funding are insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. It is clear that further action is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and achieve a just climate future. Here, we offer a new perspective on emissions responsibility and climate finance by conducting an environmentally extended input output analysis that links 30 years (1990–2019) of United States (U.S.) household-level income data to the emissions generated in creating that income. To do this we draw on over 2.8 billion inter-sectoral transfers from the Eora MRIO database to calculate both supplier- and producer-based GHG emissions intensities and connect these with detailed income and demographic data for over 5 million U.S. individuals in the IPUMS Current Population Survey. We find significant and growing emissions inequality that cuts across economic and racial lines. In 2019, fully 40\% of total U.S. emissions were associated with income flows to the highest earning 10\% of households. Among the highest earning 1\% of households (whose income is linked to 15–17\% of national emissions) investment holdings account for 38–43\% of their emissions. Even when allowing for a considerable range of investment strategies, passive income accruing to this group is a major factor shaping the U.S. emissions distribution. Results suggest an alternative income or shareholder-based carbon tax, focused on investments, may have equity advantages over traditional consumer-facing cap-and-trade or carbon tax options and be a useful policy tool to encourage decarbonization while raising revenue for climate finance.},

            The Open Targets Platform (https://platform.opentargets.org/) is an open source resource to systematically assist drug target identification and prioritisation using publicly available data. Since our last update, we have reimagined, redesigned, and rebuilt the Platform in order to streamline data integration and harmonisation, expand the ways in which users can explore the data, and improve the user experience. The gene–disease causal evidence has been enhanced and expanded to better capture disease causality across rare, common, and somatic diseases. For target and drug annotations, we have incorporated new features that help assess target safety and tractability, including genetic constraint, PROTACtability assessments, and AlphaFold structure predictions. We have also introduced new machine learning applications for knowledge extraction from the published literature, clinical trial information, and drug labels. The new technologies and frameworks introduced since the last update will ease the introduction of new features and the creation of separate instances of the Platform adapted to user requirements. Our new Community forum, expanded training materials, and outreach programme support our users in a range of use cases.},

	abstract = {Aims To compare the extent of hyperinsulinaemia among New Zealand Europeans and Polynesians (an ethnic group at high risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus). Methods A cross-sectional survey from randomly selected households was conducted in inner urban South Auckland. Subjects were either European, Maori or Pacific Islands Polynesians aged 40–79 years and were screened for diabetes using a random blood glucose. Those with an elevated result, and 20\% randomly selected from those with a normal screening result, were invited to a 75-g glucose tolerance test. WHO criteria (1998) for diabetes were used Results In those aged 40–59 years, total prevalence of diabetes was 7.5 (6.2–9.0)\% in Europeans but 21.1 (16.6–25.6)\% among Maori and 25.0 (19.8–30.1)\% among Pacific peoples; obesity (body mass index ≥ 31.0 kg/m2) was present in 26\% Europeans, 63\% Maori and 69\% Pacific peoples. Non-diabetic Polynesians were relatively hyperglycaemic and hyperinsulinaemic. After adjusting for the degree of obesity, Polynesians had similar insulin levels to Europeans. Conclusions These findings indicate that Polynesians are not intrinsically insulin resistant as a group, a prerequisite found in most other ethnic groups at high risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The high prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in Polynesians could be the result of their high prevalence of obesity.},

	abstract = {Although the first ancient DNA molecules were extracted more than three decades ago, the first ancient nuclear genomes could only be characterized after high-throughput sequencing was invented. Genome-scale data have now been gathered from thousands of ancient archaeological specimens, and the number of ancient biological tissues amenable to genome sequencing is growing steadily. Ancient DNA fragments are typically ultrashort molecules and carry extensive amounts of chemical damage accumulated after death. Their extraction, manipulation and authentication require specific experimental wet-laboratory and dry-laboratory procedures before patterns of genetic variation from past individuals, populations and species can be interpreted. Ancient DNA data help to address an entire array of questions in anthropology, evolutionary biology and the environmental and archaeological sciences. The data have revealed a considerably more dynamic past than previously appreciated and have revolutionized our understanding of many major prehistoric and historic events. This Primer provides an overview of concepts and state-of-the-art methods underlying ancient DNA analysis and illustrates the diversity of resulting applications. The article also addresses some of the ethical challenges associated with the destructive analysis of irreplaceable material, emphasizes the need to fully involve archaeologists and stakeholders as part of the research design and analytical process, and discusses future perspectives.},

The eastern-most extent of that great human migration was the Samoan Archipelago in West Polynesia, although critical questions have remained about the timing and process of Samoan colonization. To investigate those questions, we carried out a Bayesian analysis of 19 radiocarbon dates on charcoal and 8 uranium-thorium (U-Th) series coral dates from four archaeological sites on Ofu Island in the eastern reaches of Samoa. The analysis indicates initial settlement of Ofu at 2717–2663 cal BP (68.2\%) by people using Plainware rather than the diagnostic dentate-stamped Lapita pottery. This date range indicates that there is not a signiﬁcant chronological gap between Lapita and Plainware sites in Samoa, which holds implications for modeling the settlement process in the Central Paciﬁc.},

Additional excavation and survey were undertaken in 2007 to evaluate this status further and to gain new insight into the nature of the occupation and its role in the subsequent peopling of west Polynesia. A review of this project and its findings are presented. Decorated ceramics of western Lapita style, the presence of tan paste ceramics foreign to Tonga, and new radiocarbon dates support Nukuleka as a site of first landfall in the interval 2850 to 2900 cal BP. The ceramic assemblage is distinct from west and central Fiji, and an independent origin for Fijian and Polynesian colonizers is argued. The settlement quickly expanded on the Nukuleka Peninsula to 20 ha or more in size, forming a central place for the eastern Lapita province in Tonga, Samoa and the Lau islands of Fiji. Nukuleka, we believe, provides insight into the cultural if not biological base from which ancestral Polynesian society emerged.},

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technology enables population-level surveys of human genomic variation. Here, we examine the joint allele frequency distributions across continental human populations and present an approach for combining complementary aspects of whole-genome, low-coverage data and targeted high-coverage data. We apply this approach to data generated by the pilot phase of the Thousand Genomes Project, including whole-genome 2–4× coverage data for 179 samples from HapMap European, Asian, and African panels as well as high-coverage target sequencing of the exons of 800 genes from 697 individuals in seven populations. We use the site frequency spectra obtained from these data to infer demographic parameters for an Out-of-Africa model for populations of African, European, and Asian descent and to predict, by a jackknife-based approach, the amount of genetic diversity that will be discovered as sample sizes are increased. We predict that the number of discovered nonsynonymous coding variants will reach 100,000 in each population after ∼1,000 sequenced chromosomes per population, whereas ∼2,500 chromosomes will be needed for the same number of synonymous variants. Beyond this point, the number of segregating sites in the European and Asian panel populations is expected to overcome that of the African panel because of faster recent population growth. Overall, we find that the majority of human genomic variable sites are rare and exhibit little sharing among diverged populations. Our results emphasize that replication of disease association for specific rare genetic variants across diverged populations must overcome both reduced statistical power because of rarity and higher population divergence.},

            When natural populations split and migrate to different environments, they may experience different selection pressures that can lead to local adaptation. To capture the genomic patterns of a local selective sweep, we develop XP-nSL, a genomic scan for local adaptation that compares haplotype patterns between two populations. We show that XP-nSL has power to detect ongoing and recently completed hard and soft sweeps, and we then apply this statistic to search for evidence of adaptation to high altitude in rhesus macaques. We analyze the whole genomes of 23 wild rhesus macaques captured at high altitude (mean altitude \&gt; 4000 m above sea level) to 22 wild rhesus macaques captured at low altitude (mean altitude \&lt; 500 m above sea level) and find evidence of local adaptation in the high-altitude population at or near 303 known genes and several unannotated regions. We find the strongest signal for adaptation at EGLN1, a classic target for convergent evolution in several species living in low oxygen environments. Furthermore, many of the 303 genes are involved in processes related to hypoxia, regulation of ROS, DNA damage repair, synaptic signaling, and metabolism. These results suggest that, beyond adapting via a beneficial mutation in one single gene, adaptation to high altitude in rhesus macaques is polygenic and spread across numerous important biological systems.},

	abstract = {Selective sweeps can increase genetic differentiation among populations and cause allele frequency spectra to depart from the expectation under neutrality. We present a likelihood method for detecting selective sweeps that involves jointly modeling the multilocus allele frequency differentiation between two populations. We use Brownian motion to model genetic drift under neutrality, and a deterministic model to approximate the effect of a selective sweep on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity. We test the method with extensive simulated data, and demonstrate that in some scenarios the method provides higher power than previously reported approaches to detect selective sweeps, and can provide surprisingly good localization of the position of a selected allele. A strength of our technique is that it uses allele frequency differentiation between populations, which is much more robust to ascertainment bias in SNP discovery than methods based on the allele frequency spectrum. We apply this method to compare continentally diverse populations, as well as Northern and Southern Europeans. Our analysis identifies a list of loci as candidate targets of selection, including well-known selected loci and new regions that have not been highlighted by previous scans for selection.},

	abstract = {The advent of modern DNA sequencing technology is the driving force in obtaining complete intra-speciﬁc genomes that can be used to detect loci that have been subject to positive selection in the recent past. Based on selective sweep theory, beneﬁcial loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide polymorphism patterns in intraspeciﬁc genome alignments. In the last decade, a plethora of algorithms for identifying selective sweeps have been developed. However, the majority of these algorithms have not been designed for analyzing whole-genome data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used SweepFinder program. The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core processors. Furthermore, we implemented a checkpointing mechanism that allows to deploy SweeD on cluster systems with queue execution time restrictions, as well as to resume long-running analyses after processor failures. In addition, the user can specify various demographic models via the command-line to calculate their theoretically expected site frequency spectra. Therefore, (in contrast to SweepFinder) the neutral site frequencies can optionally be directly calculated from a given demographic model. We show that an increase of sample size results in more precise detection of positive selection. Thus, the ability to analyze substantially larger sample sizes by using SweeD leads to more accurate sweep detection. We validate SweeD via simulations and by scanning the ﬁrst chromosome from the 1000 human Genomes project for selective sweeps. We compare SweeD results with results from a linkage-disequilibrium-based approach and identify common outliers.},

By using Gaussian mixtures in a variational autoencoder framework, we are able to learn a low-dimensional latent space in which we cluster haplotypes along the genome in a highly scalable manner. We show that we can use haplotype clusters in the latent space to infer global population structure using haplotype information by exploiting the generative properties of our framework. Based on fitted neural networks and their latent haplotype clusters, we can perform principal component analysis and estimate ancestry proportions based on a maximum likelihood framework. Using sequencing data from simulations and closely related human populations, we show that our approach is better at distinguishing closely related populations than standard admixture and principal component analysis software. We further show that HaploNet is fast and highly scalable by applying it to genotype array data of the UK Biobank.},

This history contains rich information about the forces that have inﬂuenced a sexually reproducing species. However, existing methods are limited: the most accurate is unable to cope with more than a few dozen samples. With modern genetic data sets rapidly approaching millions of genomes, there is an urgent need for eﬃcient inference methods to exploit such rich resources. We introduce an algorithm to infer whole-genome history which has comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art but can process around four orders of magnitude more sequences. Additionally, our method results in an “evolutionary encoding” of the original sequence data, enabling eﬃcient access to genealogies and calculation of genetic statistics over the data. We apply this technique to human data from the 1000 Genomes Project, Simons Genome Diversity Project and UK Biobank, showing that the genealogies we estimate are both rich in biological signal and eﬃcient to process.},

            Since anatomically modern humans dispersed Out of Africa, the evolutionary history of Eurasian populations has been marked by introgressions from presently extinct hominins. Some of these introgressions have been identified using sequenced ancient genomes (Neanderthal and Denisova). Other introgressions have been proposed for still unidentified groups using the genetic diversity present in current human populations. We built a demographic model based on deep learning in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework to infer the evolutionary history of Eurasian populations including past introgression events in Out of Africa populations fitting the current genetic evidence. In addition to the reported Neanderthal and Denisovan introgressions, our results support a third introgression in all Asian and Oceanian populations from an archaic population. This population is either related to the Neanderthal-Denisova clade or diverged early from the Denisova lineage. We propose the use of deep learning methods for clarifying situations with high complexity in evolutionary genomics.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The demographic history of a population drives the pattern of genetic variation and is encoded in the gene-genealogical trees of the sampled alleles. However, existing methods to infer demographic history from genetic data tend to use relatively low-dimensional summaries of the genealogy, such as allele frequency spectra. As a step toward capturing more of the information encoded in the genome-wide sequence of genealogical trees, here we propose a novel framework called the genealogical likelihood (gLike), which derives the full likelihood of a genealogical tree under any hypothesized demographic history. Employing a graph-based structure, gLike summarizes across independent trees the relationships among all lineages in a tree with all possible trajectories of population memberships through time and efficiently computes the exact marginal probability under a parameterized demographic model. Through extensive simulations and empirical applications on populations that have experienced multiple admixtures, we showed that gLike can accurately estimate dozens of demographic parameters when the true genealogy is known, including ancestral population sizes, admixture timing, and admixture proportions. Moreover, when using genealogical trees inferred from genetic data, we showed that gLike outperformed conventional demographic inference methods that leverage only the allele-frequency spectrum and yielded parameter estimates that align with established historical knowledge of the past demographic histories for populations like Latino Americans and Native Hawaiians. Furthermore, our framework can trace ancestral histories by analyzing a sample from the admixed population without proxies for its source populations, removing the need to sample ancestral populations that may no longer exist. Taken together, our proposed gLike framework harnesses underutilized genealogical information to offer exceptional sensitivity and accuracy in inferring complex demographies for humans and other species, particularly as estimation of genome-wide genealogies improves.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that many traits are highly polygenic, in that their withinpopulation variance is governed, in part, by small-effect variants at many genetic loci. Standard population-genetic methods for inferring evolutionary history are ill-suited for polygenic traits: when there are many variants of small effect, signatures of natural selection are spread across the genome and are subtle at any one locus. In the last several years, various methods have emerged for detecting the action of natural selection on polygenic scores, sums of genotypes weighted by GWAS effect sizes. However, most existing methods do not reveal the timing or strength of selection. Here, we present a set of methods for estimating the historical time course of a population-mean polygenic score using local coalescent trees at GWAS loci. These time courses are estimated by using coalescent theory to relate the branch lengths of trees to allele-frequency change. The resulting time course can be tested for evidence of natural selection. We present theory and simulations supporting our procedures, as well as estimated time courses of polygenic scores for human height. Because of its grounding in coalescent theory, the framework presented here can be extended to a variety of demographic scenarios, and its usefulness will increase as both GWAS and ancestral-recombination-graph inference continue to progress.},

              Background
              Mammalian X and Y chromosomes share a common evolutionary origin and retain regions of high sequence similarity. Similar sequence content can confound the mapping of short next-generation sequencing reads to a reference genome. It is therefore possible that the presence of both sex chromosomes in a reference genome can cause technical artifacts in genomic data and affect downstream analyses and applications. Understanding this problem is critical for medical genomics and population genomic inference.
            
            
              Results
              Here, we characterize how sequence homology can affect analyses on the sex chromosomes and present XYalign, a new tool that (1) facilitates the inference of sex chromosome complement from next-generation sequencing data; (2) corrects erroneous read mapping on the sex chromosomes; and (3) tabulates and visualizes important metrics for quality control such as mapping quality, sequencing depth, and allele balance. We find that sequence homology affects read mapping on the sex chromosomes and this has downstream effects on variant calling. However, we show that XYalign can correct mismapping, resulting in more accurate variant calling. We also show how metrics output by XYalign can be used to identify XX and XY individuals across diverse sequencing experiments, including low- and high-coverage whole-genome sequencing, and exome sequencing. Finally, we discuss how the flexibility of the XYalign framework can be leveraged for other uses including the identification of aneuploidy on the autosomes. XYalign is available open source under the GNU General Public License (version 3).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Sex chromsome sequence homology causes the mismapping of short reads, which in turn affects downstream analyses. XYalign provides a reproducible framework to correct mismapping and improve variant calling on the sex chromsomes.},

            Ancient DNA has unlocked new genetic histories and shed light on archaeological and historical questions, but many known and unknown historical events have remained below detection thresholds because subtle ancestry changes are challenging to reconstruct.

            , a new approach of time-stratified ancestry analysis that can improve statistical power by an order of magnitude by focusing on coalescences in recent times, while remaining unbiased by population-specific drift. We apply this framework to 1,151 available ancient genomes, focussing on northern and central Europe in the historical period, and show that it allows modelling of individual-level ancestry using preceding genomes and provides previously unavailable resolution to detect broader ancestry transformations. In the first half of the first millennium ∼1-500 CE (Common Era), we observe an expansion of Scandinavian-related ancestry across western, central, and southern Europe. However, in the second half of the millennium ∼500-1000 CE, ancestry patterns suggest the regional disappearance or substantial admixture of these ancestries in multiple regions. Within Scandinavia itself, we document a major ancestry influx by ∼800 CE, when a large proportion of Viking Age individuals carried ancestry from groups related to continental Europe. This primarily affected southern Scandinavia, and was differentially represented in the western and eastern directions of the wider Viking world. We infer detailed ancestry portraits integrated with historical, archaeological, and stable isotope evidence, documenting mobility at an individual level. Overall, our results are consistent with substantial mobility in Europe in the early historical period, and suggest that time-stratified ancestry analysis can provide a new lens for genetic history.},

However, in this paper, we argue that the concept of admixture as currently used assumes the existence of pure or unadmixed categories. These do not need to have actually existed but to be able to exist in prin­ ciple. We argue that this is a problematic notion that accrues from the racialist origins of the term admixture, which, as a result, is based on assumptions about purity. We suggest that scientists should be very cautious in their use of this term, especially in science education and communication. We also suggest that the term admixture should be better replaced by terms denoting similarity rather than difference.},

	abstract = {Background
              French Polynesia is a French overseas collectivity in the Southeast Pacific, comprising 75 inhabited islands across five archipelagoes. The human settlement of the region corresponds to the last massive migration of humans to empty territories, but its timeline is still debated. Despite their recent population history and geographical isolation, inhabitants of French Polynesia experience health issues similar to those of continental countries. Modern lifestyles and increased longevity have led to a rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Likewise, international trade and people mobility have caused the emergence of communicable diseases (CDs) including mosquito-borne and respiratory diseases. Additionally, chronic pathologies including acute rheumatic fever, liver diseases, and ciguatera, are highly prevalent in French Polynesia. However, data on such diseases are scarce and not representative of the geographic fragmentation of the population.
            
            
              Objectives
              The present project aims to estimate the prevalence of several NCDs and CDs in the population of the five archipelagoes, and identify associated risk factors. Moreover, genetic analyses will contribute to determine the sequence and timings of the peopling history of French Polynesia, and identify causal links between past genetic adaptation to island environments, and present-day susceptibility to certain diseases.
            
            
              Methods
              This cross-sectional survey is based on the random selection of 2,100 adults aged 18–69 years and residing on 18 islands from the five archipelagoes. Each participant answered a questionnaire on a wide range of topics (including demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits and medical history), underwent physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, arterial pressure, and skin pigmentation), and provided biological samples (blood, saliva, and stool) for biological, genetic and microbiological analyses.
            
            
              Conclusion
              For the first time in French Polynesia, the present project allows to collect a wide range of data to explore the existence of indicators and/or risk factors for multiple pathologies of public health concern. The results will help health authorities to adapt actions and preventive measures aimed at reducing the incidence of NCDs and CDs. Moreover, the new genomic data generated in this study, combined with anthropological data, will increase our understanding of the peopling history of French Polynesia.

Here we describe the first region-wide analysis of genome-wide data from population groups spanning Oceania and its surroundings, from island and peninsular southeast Asia to Papua New Guinea, east across the Pacific through Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, and west across the Indian Ocean to related island populations in the Andamans and Madagascar. In total we generate and analyze genome-wide data from 981 individuals from 92 different populations, 58 separate islands, and 30 countries, representing the most expansive study of Pacific genetics to date. In each sample we disentangle the Papuan and more recent Austronesian ancestries, which have admixed in various proportions across this region, using ancestry-specific analyses, and characterize the distinct patterns of settlement, migration, and archaic introgression separately in these two ancestries. We also focus on the patterns of clinically relevant genetic variation across Oceania--a landscape rippled with strong founder effects and island-specific genetic drift in allele frequencies--providing an atlas for the development of precision genetic health strategies in this understudied region of the world.},

It remains unknown to what extent the distribution of Malayo-Polynesian languages has been shaped by back migrations and language leveling events following the initial Out-of-Taiwan expansion. Other aspects of language history, including the effect of language switching from non-Austronesian languages, also remain poorly understood. Here we apply Bayesian phylogenetic methods to a core-vocabulary dataset of Philippine languages. Our analysis strongly supports a sister group relationship between the Sangiric and Minahasan groups of Northern Sulawesi on one hand, and the rest of the Philippine languages on the other, which is incompatible with a simple North-to-South dispersal from Taiwan. We find a pervasive geographical signal in our results, suggesting a dominant role for cultural diffusion in the evolution of Philippine languages. However, we do find some support for a later migration of Gorontalo-Mongondow languages to Northern Sulawesi from the Philippines. Subsequent diffusion processes between languages in Sulawesi appear to have led to conflicting data and a highly unstable phylogenetic position for Gorontalo-Mongondow. In the Philippines, language switching to Austronesian in ‘Negrito’ groups appears to have occurred at different time-points throughout the Philippines, and based on our analysis, there is no discernible effect of language switching on the basic vocabulary.},

	abstract = {The tropical archipelago of Wallacea was first settled by anatomically modern humans (AMH) by 50 thousand years ago (kya), with descendent populations thought to have remained genetically isolated prior to the arrival of Austronesian seafarers around 3.5 kya. Modern Wallaceans exhibit a longitudinal countergradient of Papuan- and Asian-related ancestries widely considered as evidence for mixing between local populations and Austronesian seafarers, though converging multidisciplinary evidence suggests that the Papuan-related component instead comes primarily from back-migrations from New Guinea. Here, we reconstruct Wallacean population genetic history using more than 250 newly reported genomes from 12 Wallacean and three West Papuan populations and confirm that the vast majority of Papuan-related ancestry in Wallacea ({\textasciitilde}75–100\%) comes from prehistoric migrations originating in New Guinea and only a minor fraction is attributable to the founding AMH settlers. Mixing between Papuan and local Wallacean lineages appear to have been confined to the western and central parts of the archipelago and likely occurred contemporaneously with the widespread introduction of genes from Austronesian seafarers—which now comprise between {\textasciitilde}40–85\% of modern Wallacean ancestry—though dating historical admixture events remains challenging due to mixing continuing into the Historical Period. In conjunction with archaeological and linguistic records, our findings point to a dynamic Wallacean population history that was profoundly reshaped by the spread of Papuan genes, languages, and culture in the past 3,500 years.},

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive amounts of genetic variation data for diverse genomes, but it remains a challenge to pinpoint a small subset of functionally important variants. To fill these unmet needs, we developed the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a ‘variants reduction’ protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene. Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires \$4 min to perform gene-based annotation and \$15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day.

            Highlanders and lowlanders of Papua New Guinea have faced distinct environmental stress, such as hypoxia and environment-specific pathogen exposure, respectively. In this study, we explored the top genomics regions and the candidate driver SNPs for selection in these two populations using newly sequenced whole-genomes of 54 highlanders and 74 lowlanders. We identified two candidate SNPs under selection - one in highlanders, associated with red blood cell traits and another in lowlanders, which is associated with white blood cell count – both potentially influencing the heart rate of Papua New Guineans in opposite directions. We also observed four candidate driver SNPs that exhibit linkage disequilibrium with an introgressed haplotype, highlighting the need to explore the possibility of adaptive introgression within these populations. This study reveals that the signatures of positive selection in highlanders and lowlanders of Papua New Guinea align closely with the challenges they face, which are specific to their environments.},

Among these indigenous Oceanic cultures are the intrepid Polynesian double-hulled canoe navigators, the atoll dwellers of Micronesia, the statue carvers of remote Easter Island, and the famed traders of Melanesia. Decades of archaeological excavations, combined with allied research in historical linguistics, biological anthropology, and comparative ethnography, have revealed much new information about the long-term history of these Pacific Island societies and cultures. On the Road of the Winds synthesizes the grand sweep of human history in the Pacific Islands, beginning with the movement of early people out from Asia more than 40,000 years ago, and tracing the development of myriad indigenous cultures up to the time of European contact in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. This updated edition, enhanced with many new illustrations and an extensive bibliography, synthesizes the latest archaeological, linguistic, and biological discoveries that reveal the grand sweep of ancient history in the Pacific Islands"--Provided by publisher},

              . There are about three dozen language families and close to the same number of language isolates, although two very different language families, each with about 300 languages, dominate: the coastal Austronesian languages, and the montane Trans New Guinea family. The other, smaller families are largely restricted to the northern lowlands. Typologically, the languages exhibit enormous variation and many unusual properties. Vowel systems in which central vowels predominate and consonantal systems lacking fricatives and, rarer still, nasals are attested. Morphological types range from isolating to polysynthetic, and most languages are head marking. Verbs normally carry more complex inflection than do nouns. Of nominal categories, gender is often exuberantly elaborated, but surprisingly case is not, the weak development being an areal feature, in contrast to Australian languages on the one hand and those of Eurasia on the other. Syntactically, languages fall into left-headed and right-headed types, represented by Austronesian and Trans New Guinea, respectively. Clause chaining and associated morphological structures such as switch reference are a salient feature of right-headed and particularly Trans New Guinea languages. Discourse structures are often highly elliptical, with the verbal morphology providing signals for the recovery of elided information and the cohesion of the text. Highly ritualized texts, such as songs, are characterized by strict formal rules of parallelism and trope usage. Other than Austronesian, no language family has congeners outside the region, and within it, large-scale processes of convergence have shaped languages over many millennia, giving rise to areal traits.},

	abstract = {The region of the ancient Sahul continent (present day Australia and New Guinea, and surrounding islands) is home to extreme linguistic diversity. Even apart from the huge Austronesian language family, which spread into the area after the breakup of the Sahul continent in the Holocene, there are hundreds of languages from many apparently unrelated families. On each of the subcontinents, the generally accepted classification recognizes one large, widespread family and a number of unrelatable smaller families. If these language families are related to each other, it is at a depth which is inaccessible to standard linguistic methods. We have inferred the history of structural characteristics of these languages under an admixture model, using a Bayesian algorithm originally developed to discover populations on the basis of recombining genetic markers. This analysis identifies 10 ancestral language populations, some of which can be identified with clearly defined phylogenetic groups. The results also show traces of early dispersals, including hints at ancient connections between Australian languages and some Papuan groups (long hypothesized, never before demonstrated). Systematic language contact effects between members of big phylogenetic groups are also detected, which can in some cases be identified with a diffusional or substrate signal. Most interestingly, however, there remains striking evidence of a phylogenetic signal, with many languages showing negligible amounts of admixture.},

Data from the New Guinea Highlands (at an elevation of {\textasciitilde}2000 meters) demonstrate the exploitation of the endemic nut

	abstract = {Although often seen as a singular historical phenomenon, it is likely that the prehistory witnessed archaeologically by Lapita pottery and other associated artifacts differed significantly in Near Oceania from the tale told about this pottery in Remote Oceania. There is a high baseline probability that Lapita evolved in the Bismarck Archipelago as part of an ancient, broadly distributed community of practice among diverse local residential communities. In contrast, around 3,000 years ago and after a number of generations in Near Oceania, some of the bearers of Lapita pottery sailed away to colonize what had hitherto been the uninhabited islands to the south and east. Thereafter, due perhaps to the greater distances among the major Remote Oceanic archipelagoes, Lapita as an archaeological complex bears witness mostly to the shared ancestry of these pioneers rather than to their continuing mutual engagement in a newly founded, more expansive regional community of practice.},

	abstract = {The subsistence strategies of the Lapita populations (3100–2800 BP), the ﬁrst colonisers of the pristine environments of the islands of Eastern Melanesia and Western Polynesia, have been a matter of ongoing debate for decades. Opinions have ranged between the two extremes of Lapita colonisers being either characterised as highly mobile foragers to fully horticultural communities. To further address the question, this paper presents stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic data obtained from analyses of human and animal collagen samples from the site of Teouma (Efate, Vanuatu) dated to between c. 3000–2500 BP. The isotopic signatures obtained from 28 samples (23 human and 5 animal), interpreted in combination with isotopic information from several coastal and insular environments, suggest a diet primarily made up of terrestrially derived animal protein with lesser contributions from vegetable produce and inshore marine species. Comparisons linking the isotopic data gleaned from the Teouma individuals and Lapita subsistence patterns reconstructed through archaeozoological and archaeobotanical remains support the hypothesis of a mixed economy, that included terrestrial foraging, inshore marine exploitation and a low level of food production for at least some of the earliest Lapita colonists in Vanuatu.},

@article{kayser_melanesian_2000,
	title = {Melanesian origin of {Polynesian} {Y} chromosomes},
	abstract = {Background: Two competing hypotheses for the origins of Polynesians are the ‘express-train’ model, which supposes a recent and rapid expansion of Polynesian ancestors from Asia/Taiwan via coastal and island Melanesia, and the ‘entangled-bank’ model, which supposes a long history of cultural and genetic interactions among Southeast Asians, Melanesians and Polynesians. Most genetic data, especially analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation, support the express-train model, as does linguistic and archaeological evidence. Here, we used Y-chromosome polymorphisms to investigate the origins of Polynesians.
Results: We analysed eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and seven short tandem repeat (STR) loci on the Y chromosome in 28 Cook Islanders from Polynesia and 583 males from 17 Melanesian, Asian and Australian populations. We found that all Polynesians belong to just three Y-chromosome haplotypes, as defined by unique event polymorphisms. The major Y haplotype in Polynesians (82\% frequency) was restricted to Melanesia and eastern Indonesia and most probably arose in Melanesia. Coalescence analysis of associated Y-STR haplotypes showed evidence of a population expansion in Polynesians, beginning about 2,200 years ago. The other two Polynesian Y haplotypes were widespread in Asia but were also found in Melanesia.

All rights reserved.
Conclusions: All Polynesian Y chromosomes can be traced back to Melanesia, although some of these Y-chromosome types originated in Asia. Together with other genetic and cultural evidence, we propose a new model of Polynesian origins that we call the ‘slow-boat’ model: Polynesian ancestors did originate from Asia/Taiwan but did not move rapidly through Melanesia; rather, they interacted with and mixed extensively with Melanesians, leaving behind their genes and incorporating many Melanesian genes before colonising the Pacific.},

This is found frequently in Melanesians and Poiynesians but not in five other populations in which athalassemia is prevalent.

	abstract = {Remote Oceania was colonized ca. 3000 BP by populations associated with the Lapita Cultural Complex, marking a major event in the prehistoric settlement of the Pacific Islands. Although over 250 Lapita sites have been found throughout the Western Pacific, human remains associated with Lapita period sites are rare. The site of Teouma, on Efate Island, Vanuatu has yielded the largest burial assemblage (n = 68 inhumations) of Lapita period humans ever discovered, providing a unique opportunity for assessing human adaptation to the environment in a colonizing population. Stable isotope ratios (d13C, d15N, d34S) of human bone collagen from forty-nine Teouma adults were analyzed against a comprehensive dietary baseline to assess the paleodiet of some of Vanuatu’s earliest inhabitants. The isotopic dietary baseline included both modern plants and animals (n = 98) and prehistoric fauna from the site (n = 71). The human stable isotope data showed that dietary protein at Teouma included a mixture of reef fish and inshore organisms and a variety of higher trophic marine (e.g. marine turtle) and terrestrial animals (e.g. domestic animals and fruit bats). The domestic pigs and chickens at Teouma primarily ate food from a C3 terrestrial environment but their d15N values indicated that they were eating foods from higher trophic levels than those of plants, such as insects or human fecal matter, suggesting that animal husbandry at the site may have included free range methods. The dietary interpretations for the humans suggest that broad-spectrum foraging and the consumption of domestic animals were the most important methods for procuring dietary protein at the site. Males displayed significantly higher d15N values compared with females, possibly suggesting dietary differences associated with labor specialization or socio-cultural practices relating to food distribution.},

Rather than focusing on long-distance voyaging and migrations of Polynesian people into the Micronesian and Melanesian regions, we synthesised archaeological and biological data, the latter frequently omitted from this type of analysis, from the regions in question. While cultural remains show sporadic evidence of external contacts, biological data display a North-South cline emphasising a decrease of Polynesian affinities from Micronesia to SouthMelanesia.

A limited number of radiocarbon dates are one line of evidence supporting this claim, but they cannot precisely establish when this event occurred, nor can they afford a detailed chronology for sequent occupation. High precision U/Th dates of Acropora coral files (abraders) from Nukuleka give unprecedented resolution, identifying the founder event by 283868 BP and documenting site development over the ensuing 250 years. The potential for dating error due to post depositional diagenetic alteration of ancient corals at Nukuleka also is addressed through sample preparation protocols and paired dates on spatially separated samples for individual specimens. Acropora coral files are widely distributed in Lapita sites across Oceania. U/Th dating of these artifacts provides unparalleled opportunities for greater precision and insight into the speed and timing of this final chapter in human settlement of the globe.},

Two new radiocarbon determinations of material associated with Lapita pottery found at Mulifanua are presented. The accuracy of this data is evaluated according to the results of recent reassessment of pottery from the site, and current theories regarding the age of Lapita settlement in the eastern Pacific. The resulting calibrated radiocarbon ages put occupation of the Mulifanua Lapita site at around 2880-2750 cal BP (930–800 BC). This conclusion is in agreement with the pottery chronology and supports recent hypotheses of rapid Lapita settlement in the Fiji/Tonga region around 2850–2700 cal BP (900–750 BC).},

	abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a genomic approach for the detection and quantitative analysis of messenger RNA molecules in a biological sample and is useful for studying cellular responses. RNA-seq has fueled much discovery and innovation in medicine over recent years. For practical reasons, the technique is usually conducted on samples comprising thousands to millions of cells. However, this has hindered direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biology—the cell. Since the first single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study was published in 2009, many more have been conducted, mostly by specialist laboratories with unique skills in wet-lab single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and computation. However, with the increasing commercial availability of scRNA-seq platforms, and the rapid ongoing maturation of bioinformatics approaches, a point has been reached where any biomedical researcher or clinician can use scRNA-seq to make exciting discoveries. In this review, we present a practical guide to help researchers design their first scRNA-seq studies, including introductory information on experimental hardware, protocol choice, quality control, data analysis and biological interpretation.},

The primary analyses were adjusted for age, sex, the first four genome-wide principal components and (where appropriate) BMI, waist circumference and type 2 diabetes. The primary analysis was conducted in ancestrally defined groups and association effects were combined using meta-analysis.
Results For the A allele of rs373863828, the effect size was 0.038 (95\% CI 0.022, 0.055, p = 4.8 × 10−6) for log-transformed BMI, with OR 0.59 (95\% CI 0.47, 0.73, p = 1.9 × 10−6) for type 2 diabetes. There was no evidence for an association of genotype with variance in BMI (p = 0.13), and nor was there evidence for associations with serum urate (β = 0.012 mmol/l, pcorrected = 0.10), gout (OR 1.00, p = 0.98) or CKD (OR 0.91, p = 0.59).

Associations were analysed with adjustment for age, sex, ESRD and the first four genetic principal components from a genome-wide association study (to account for population stratification); a genomic control procedure was used to account for residual stratification.
Results The G allele at rs12513649 had an overall frequency of 7.7\%, which varied from 2.2\% to 20.7\% across different Marianas and Micronesian populations; overall frequency of the A allele at rs373863828 was 4.2\% (range: 1.1–5.4\%). The G allele at rs12513649 was associated with higher BMI (β = 1.55 kg/m2 per copy; p = 0.0026) as was the A allele at rs373863828 (β = 1.48 kg/m2, p = 0.033). The same alleles were associated with lower risk of diabetes (OR per copy: 0.63 [p = 0.0063] and 0.49 [p = 0.0022], respectively). Meta-analyses combining the current results with previous results in Polynesians showed a strong association between the A allele at rs373863828 and BMI (β = 1.38 kg/m2; p = 2.5 × 10−29) and diabetes (OR 0.65, p = 1.5 × 10−13).

The mechanisms that drive assembly of these parallel connections, and the functional implications of their specificity remain unresolved. Here we show that in absence of contactin 4 (CNTN4) or one of its binding partners, amyloid precursor protein (APP), a subset of direction selective retinal ganglion cells fail to target the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT) - the accessory optic system (AOS) target controlling horizontal image stabilization. Conversely, ectopic expression of CNTN4 biases RGCs to arborize in the NOT, and that process also requires APP. Our data reveal critical and novel roles for CNTN4/APP in promoting target-specific axon arborization and they highlight the importance of this process for functional development of a behaviorally-relevant parallel visual pathway.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct linkage analysis for body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), visceral adipose tissue mass (VAT, cm2) and subcutaneous adipose tissue mass (SAT, cm2) using a whole genome scan. DESIGN: Cross-sectional family study. STUDY SUBJECTS: African-American families from Los Angeles (AA, n ¼ 21 extended pedigrees) and Hispanic-American families (HA) from San Antonio, TX (HA-SA, n ¼ 33 extended pedigrees) and San Luis Valley, CO (HA-SLV, n ¼ 12 extended pedigrees), totaling 1049 individuals in the Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerosis (IRAS) Family Study.
MEASUREMENTS: VAT and SAT were measured using a computed tomography scan obtained at the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. All phenotypes were adjusted for age, gender, and study center. VAT, SAT, and WHR were analyzed both unadjusted and adjusted for BMI.
RESULTS: Significant linkage to BMI was found at D3S2387 (LOD ¼ 3.67) in African-Americans, and at D17S1290 in HispanicAmericans (LOD ¼ 2.76). BMI-adjusted WHR was linked to 12q13–21 (D12S297 (LOD ¼ 2.67) and D12S1052 (LOD ¼ 2.60)) in Hispanic-Americans. The peak LOD score for BMI-adjusted VAT was found at D11S2006 (2.36) in Hispanic families from San Antonio. BMI-adjusted SAT was linked to D5S820 in Hispanic families (LOD ¼ 2.64). Evidence supporting linkage of WHR at D11S2006, VAT at D17S1290, and SAT at D1S1609, D3S2387, and D6S1056 was dependent on BMI, such that the LOD scores became nonsignificant after adjustment of these phenotypes for BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings both replicate previous linkage regions and suggest novel regions in the genome that may harbor quantitative trait locis contributing to variation in measures of adiposity.

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-015-1515-3},
	abstract = {Background: Genetic heritability and expression study have shown that different diabetes traits have common genetic components and pathways. A computationally efficient pathway analysis of GWAS results will benefit postGWAS study of SNP associations and identification of common genetic pathways from diabetes GWAS can help to improve understanding of the disease pathogenesis.
Results: We proposed a uniform-score gene-set analysis (USGSA) with implemented package to unify different gene measures by a uniform score for identifying pathways from GWAS data, and use a pre-generated permutation distribution table to quickly obtain multiple-testing adjusted p-value. Simulation studies of uniform score for four gene measures (minP, 2ndP, simP and fishP) have shown that USGSA has strictly controlled family-wise error rate. The power depends on types of gene measure. USGSA with a two-stage study strategy was applied to identify common pathways associated with diabetes traits based on public dbGaP GWAS results. The study identified 7 gene sets that contain binding motifs at promoter region of component genes for 5 transcription factors (TFs) of FOXO4, TCF3, NFAT, VSX1 and POU2F1, and 1 microRNA of mir-218. These gene sets include 25 common genes that are among top 5\% of the gene associations over genome for all GWAS. Previous evidences showed that nearly all of these genes are mainly expressed in the brain.
Conclusions: USGSA is a computationally efficient approach for pathway analysis of GWAS data with promoted interpretability and comparability. The pathway analysis suggested that different diabetes traits share common pathways and component genes are potentially regulated by common TFs and microRNA. The result also indicated that the central nervous system has a critical role in diabetes pathogenesis. The findings will be important in formulating novel hypotheses for guiding follow-up studies.},

	doi = {10.2337/diabetes.53.1.25},
	abstract = {Increased intramyocellular lipid concentrations are thought to play a role in insulin resistance, but the precise nature of the lipid species that produce insulin resistance in human muscle are unknown. Ceramides, either generated via activation of sphingomyelinase or produced by de novo synthesis, induce insulin resistance in cultured cells by inhibitory effects on insulin signaling. The present study was undertaken to determine whether ceramides or other sphingolipids are increased in muscle from obese insulin-resistant subjects and to assess whether ceramide plays a role in the insulin resistance of Akt in human muscle. Lean insulin-sensitive and obese insulin-resistant subjects (n = 10 each) received euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps with muscle biopsies basally and after 30, 45, or 60 min of insulin infusion. The rate of glucose infusion required to maintain euglycemia (reflecting glucose uptake) was reduced by \&gt;50\%, as expected, in the obese subjects at each time point (P \&lt; 0.01). Under basal conditions, total muscle ceramide content was increased nearly twofold in the obese subjects (46 ± 9 vs. 25 ± 2 pmol/2 mg muscle, P \&lt; 0.05). All species of ceramides were increased similarly in the obese subjects; in contrast, no other sphingolipid was increased. Stimulation of Akt phosphorylation by insulin in the obese subjects was significantly reduced after 30 min (0.96 ± 0.11 vs. 1.84 ± 0.38 arbitrary units) or 45–60 min (0.68 ± 0.17 vs. 1.52 ± 0.26) of insulin infusion (P \&lt; 0.05 for both). Muscle ceramide content was significantly correlated with the plasma free fatty acid concentration (r = 0.51, P \&lt; 0.05). We conclude that obesity is associated with increased intramyocellular ceramide content. This twofold increase in ceramide may be involved in the decrease in Akt phosphorylation observed after insulin infusion and could theoretically play a role in the reduced ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle from obese subjects.},

              Insulin secretion is a tightly regulated process that is vital for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. Although the molecular components of insulin granule trafficking and secretion are well established, how they are regulated to rapidly fine-tune secretion in response to changing environmental conditions is not well characterized. Recent studies have determined that dysregulation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and aberrant mRNA splicing occurs at the onset of diabetes. We demonstrate that the RBP, RBFOX2, is a critical regulator of insulin secretion through the alternative splicing of genes required for insulin granule docking and exocytosis. Conditional mutation of
              Rbfox2
              in the mouse pancreas results in decreased insulin secretion and impaired blood glucose homeostasis. Consistent with defects in secretion, we observe reduced insulin granule docking and corresponding splicing defects in the SNARE complex components. These findings identify an additional mechanism for modulating insulin secretion in both healthy and dysfunctional pancreatic β cells.},

	abstract = {Background: Myopia is the most common ocular disorder worldwide and imposes tremendous burden on the society. It is a complex disease. The MYP6 locus at 22 q12 is of particular interest because many studies have detected linkage signals at this interval. The MYP6 locus is likely to contain susceptibility gene(s) for myopia, but none has yet been identified.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Two independent subject groups of southern Chinese in Hong Kong participated in the study an initial study using a discovery sample set of 342 cases and 342 controls, and a follow-up study using a replication sample set of 316 cases and 313 controls. Cases with high myopia were defined by spherical equivalent \# -8 dioptres and emmetropic controls by spherical equivalent within 61.00 dioptre for both eyes. Manual candidate gene selection from the MYP6 locus was supported by objective in silico prioritization. DNA samples of discovery sample set were genotyped for 178 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 26 genes. For replication, 25 SNPs (tagging or located at predicted transcription factor or microRNA binding sites) from 4 genes were subsequently examined using the replication sample set. Fisher P value was calculated for all SNPs and overall association results were summarized by meta-analysis. Based on initial and replication studies, rs2009066 located in the crystallin beta A4 (CRYBA4) gene was identified to be the most significantly associated with high myopia (initial study: P = 0.02; replication study: P = 1.88e-4; meta-analysis: P = 1.54e-5) among all the SNPs tested. The association result survived correction for multiple comparisons. Under the allelic genetic model for the combined sample set, the odds ratio of the minor allele G was 1.41 (95\% confidence intervals, 1.21-1.64).
Conclusions/Significance: A novel susceptibility gene (CRYBA4) was discovered for high myopia. Our study also signified the potential importance of appropriate gene prioritization in candidate selection.},

Revealing the molecular mechanism of metabolic disorder and exploring drug targets are crucial for the treatment of glucose and lipid metabolic diseases. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of various metabolic diseases. Herein, GAPDH-knockdown ZFL cells and GAPDH-downregulation zebrafish exhibited significant lipid deposition increase and glycogen reduction, thus inducing glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. Using high-sensitivity mass spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis, we identified 6838 proteins and 3738 phosphorylated proteins in GAPDH-knockdown ZFL cells. The protein-protein interaction network and DEPPs analyses showed that gsk3baY216 were involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, which was verified by In vitro study. The enzyme activity analysis and cell staining results showed that HepG2 and NCTC-1469 cells transfected with GSK3BY216F plasmid had significantly lower glucose and insulin levels, the decreased lipid deposition, and the increased glycogen synthesis than those transfected with GSK3BY216E plasmid, suggesting that inhibition of GSK3B phos­ phorylation could significantly improve GSK3B hyperphosphorylation-induced glucose tolerance impairment and insulin sensitivity reduction. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-omic study of GAPDH-knockdown ZFL cells. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of glucose and lipid metabolic disorder, and provides potential targets (kinases) for the treatments of human glucose and lipid metabolic diseases.},

              Insufficient pancreatic β-cell mass or function results in diabetes mellitus. While significant progress has been made in regulating insulin secretion from β-cells in diabetic patients, no pharmacological agents have been described that increase β-cell replication in humans. Here we report aminopyrazine compounds that stimulate robust β-cell proliferation in adult primary islets, most likely as a result of combined inhibition of DYRK1A and GSK3B. Aminopyrazine-treated human islets retain functionality
              in vitro

Oral dosing of these compounds in diabetic mice induces β-cell proliferation, increases β-cell mass and insulin content, and improves glycaemic control. Biochemical, genetic and cell biology data point to Dyrk1a as the key molecular target. This study supports the feasibility of treating diabetes with an oral therapy to restore β-cell mass, and highlights a tractable pathway for future drug discovery efforts.},

Recent genetic mouse studies suggest that speciﬁc sphingolipid C16:0 ceramide produced by ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6) plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance. However, the therapeutic potential of CerS6 inhibition not been demonstrated. Therefore, we pharmacologically investigated the selective ablation of CerS6 using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) in obese insulin resistance animal models.
Methods: We utilized ASO as therapeutic modality, CerS6 ASO molecules designed and synthesized were initially screened for in-vitro knockdown (KD) potency and cytotoxicity. ASOs with {\textgreater}85\% inhibition of CerS6 mRNA were selected for further investigations. Most promising ASOs veriﬁed for in-vivo KD efﬁcacy in healthy mice. CerS6 ASO (AAGATGAGCCGCACC) was found most active with hepatic reduction of CerS6 mRNA expression. Prior to longitudinal metabolic studies, we performed a dose titration target engagement analysis with CerS6 ASO in healthy mice to select the optimal dose. Next, we utilized leptin deﬁciency ob/ob and high fat diet (HFD) induced obese mouse models for pharmacological efﬁcacy study.
Results: CerS6 expression were signiﬁcantly elevated in the liver and brown adipose, this was correlated with signiﬁcantly elevated C16:0 ceramide concentrations in plasma and liver. Treatment with CerS6 ASO selectively reduced CerS6 expression by w90\% predominantly in the liver and this CerS6 KD resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of C16:0 ceramide by about 50\% in both liver and plasma. CerS6 KD resulted in lower body weight gain and accompanied by a signiﬁcant reduction in whole body fat and fed/fasted blood glucose levels (1\% reduction in HbA1c). Moreover, ASO-mediated CerS6 KD signiﬁcantly improved oral glucose tolerance (during oGTT) and mice displayed improved insulin sensitivity. Thus, CerS6 appear to play an important role in the development of obesity and insulin resistance.
Conclusions: Our investigations identiﬁed speciﬁc and selective therapeutic valid ASO for CerS6 ablation in in-vivo. CerS6 should speciﬁcally be targeted for the reduction of C16:0 ceramides, that results in amelioration of insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and obesity. CerS6 mediated C16:0 ceramide reduction could be a potentially attractive target for the treatment of insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes.},

Methods: C57BL/6 WT and CerS6 KO mice of both sexes were fed either a Lieber-DeCarli control (CON) or 15\% ethanol (EtOH) diet for six weeks. In vivo metabolic tests including glucose and insulin tolerance tests (GTT and ITT) and energy expenditure were performed. The mice were euthanized, and serum and liver lipids and liver histology were examined. For in vitro studies, CerS6 was deleted in human hepatocytes, VL17A and cells were incubated with EtOH and/or C16:0-ceramides. RNAseq analysis was performed in livers from mice and human patients with different stages of ALD and diseased controls.
Results: After six weeks on an EtOH diet, CerS6 KO mice had reduced body weight, food intake, and \%fat mass compared to WT mice. Energy expenditure increased in both male and female KO mice, however, was only statistically signiﬁcant in male mice. In response to EtOH, WT mice developed mild hepatic steatosis, while steatosis was ameliorated in KO mice as determined by H\&E and ORO staining. KO mice showed signiﬁcantly decreased long-chain ceramide species, especially C16:0-ceramides, in the serum and liver tissues compared to WT mice. CerS6 deletion decreased serum TG and NEFA only in male not female mice. CerS6 deletion improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in EtOHfed mice of both sexes. RNAseq analysis revealed that 74 genes are signiﬁcantly upregulated and 66 genes are downregulated by CerS6 deletion in EtOH-fed male mice, with key network pathways including TG biosynthetic process, positive regulation of lipid localization, and fat cell differentiation. Similar to RNAseq results, absence of CerS6 signiﬁcantly decreased mRNA expression of lipid droplet associated proteins in EtOH-fed mice. In vitro, EtOH stimulation signiﬁcantly increased PLIN2 protein expression in VL17A cells while CerS6 deletion inhibited EtOH-mediated PLIN2 upregulation. C16:0-ceramide treatment signiﬁcantly increased PLIN2 protein expression compared to CON. Notably, progression of ALD in humans was associated with increased hepatic CerS6 expression.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings demonstrate that CerS6 deletion improves glucose homeostasis in alcohol-fed mice and exhibits sex-based differences in the attenuation of EtOH-induced weight gain and hepatic steatosis. Additionally, we unveil that CerS6 plays a major role as a regulator of lipid droplet biogenesis in alcohol-induced intra-hepatic lipid droplet formation, identifying it as a putative target for early ALD management.

	abstract = {Ceramides increase during obesity and promote insulin resistance. Ceramides vary in acyl-chain lengths from C14:0 to C30:0 and are synthesized by six ceramide synthase enzymes (CerS1–6). It remains unresolved whether obesity-associated alterations of speciﬁc CerSs and their deﬁned acyl-chain length ceramides contribute to the manifestation of metabolic diseases. Here we reveal that CERS6 mRNA expression and C16:0 ceramides are elevated in adipose tissue of obese humans, and increased CERS6 expression correlates with insulin resistance. Conversely, CerS6-deﬁcient (CerS6D/D) mice exhibit reduced C16:0 ceramides and are protected from high-fatdiet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. CerS6 deletion increases energy expenditure and improves glucose tolerance, not only in CerS6D/D mice, but also in brown adipose tissue- (CerS6DBAT) and liverspeciﬁc (CerS6DLIVER) CerS6 knockout mice. CerS6 deﬁciency increases lipid utilization in BAT and liver. These experiments highlight CerS6 inhibition as a speciﬁc approach for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, circumventing the side effects of global ceramide synthesis inhibition.},

We performed a genome-wide association study and a replication study in Chinese Hans comprising 8,569 T2D case subjects and 8,923 control subjects in total, from which 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected for further follow-up in a de novo replication sample of 3,410 T2D case and 3,412 control subjects and an in silico replication sample of 6,952 T2D case and 11,865 control subjects. Besides confirming seven established T2D loci (CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, KCNQ1, CDC123, GLIS3, HNF1B, and DUSP9) at genome-wide significance, we identified two novel T2D loci, including G-protein–coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) (rs10886471: P = 7.1 × 10−9) and RASGRP1 (rs7403531: P = 3.9 × 10−9), of which the association signal at GRK5 seems to be specific to East Asians. In nondiabetic individuals, the T2D risk-increasing allele of RASGRP1-rs7403531 was also associated with higher HbA1c and lower homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (P = 0.03 and 0.0209, respectively), whereas the T2D risk-increasing allele of GRK5-rs10886471 was also associated with higher fasting insulin (P = 0.0169) but not with fasting glucose. Our findings not only provide new insights into the pathophysiology of T2D, but may also shed light on the ethnic differences in T2D susceptibility.},

	abstract = {Background: The two genome-wide association studies published by us and by the Wellcome Trust Case–Control Consortium (WTCCC) revealed a number of novel loci, but neither had the statistical power to elucidate all of the genetic components of type 1 diabetes risk, a task for which larger effective sample sizes are needed.
Methods: We analysed data from two sources: (1) The previously published second stage of our study, with a total sample size of the two stages consisting of 1046 Canadian case–parent trios and 538 multiplex families with 929 affected offspring from the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC); (2) the Rapid Response 2 (RR2) project of the T1DGC, which genotyped 4417 individuals from 1062 non-overlapping families, including 2059 affected individuals (mostly sibling pairs) for the 1536 markers with the highest statistical significance for type 1 diabetes in the WTCCC results.
Results: One locus, mapping to a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block at chr15q14, reached statistical significance by combining results from two markers (rs17574546 and rs7171171) in perfect LD with each other (r2 = 1). We obtained a joint p value of 1.361026, which exceeds by an order of magnitude the conservative threshold of 3.2661025 obtained by correcting for the 1536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested in our study. Meta-analysis with the original WTCCC genome-wide data produced a p value of 5.8361029.
Conclusions: A novel type 1 diabetes locus was discovered. It involves RASGRP1, a gene known to play a crucial role in thymocyte differentiation and T cell receptor (TCR) signalling by activating the Ras signalling pathway.},

Thus far, the analogy between corneal crystallins and lens crystallins has been limited to similarities in the abundant expression, with few reports concerning their structural function. This review covers recent studies that establish a clear relationship between expression of corneal crystallins and light scattering from corneal stromal cells, i.e. keratocytes, that support a structural role for corneal crystallins in the development of transparency similar to that of lens crystallins that would be consistent with the ‘refracton’ hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Rbfox1 is a splicing regulator that has been associated with various neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. We show that in adult rodent retinas, Rbfox1 is expressed in all types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in certain subsets of amacrine cells (ACs), within the inner nuclear (INL) and ganglion cell (GCL) layers. In the INL, all Rbfox1-positive cells were colocalized with GABAergic ACs, however not all GABAergic ACs were immunostained for Rbfox1. In the GCL, a vast majority of GABAergic dACs were Rbfox1-immunopositive. Furthermore, all cholinergic starburst ACs (SACs) in the INL (type a) and in the GCL (type b) were Rbfox1 positive. The expression of Rbfox1 in the retina significantly overlapped with expression of Rbfox2, another member of Rbfox family of proteins. Rbfox2, in addition to RGCs and ACs, was also expressed in horizontal cells. In developing retinas at E12 and E15, Rbfox1 is localized to the cytoplasm of differentiating RGCs and ACs. Between P0 and P5, Rbfox1 subcellular localization switched from cytoplasmic to predominantly nuclear. Downregulation of Rbfox1 in adult Rbfox1loxP/loxP mice had no detectable effect on retinal gross morphology. However, the visual cliff test revealed marked abnormalities of depth perception of these animals. RNA sequencing of retinal transcriptomes of control and Rbfox1 knockout animals identified a number of Rbfox1-regulated genes that are involved in establishing neuronal circuits and synaptic transmission, including Vamp1, Vamp2, Snap25, Trak2, and Slc1A7, suggesting the role of Rbfox1 in facilitating synaptic communications between ACs and RGCs.},

	abstract = {Rbfox1 is a multifunctional RNA binding protein that regulates various aspects of RNA metabolism important for neuronal differentiation and normal physiology. Rbfox1 has been associated with neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions as well as age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. We have shown that in mammalian retinas Rbfox1 is expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in amacrine cells (ACs). This study investigates the effect of advanced age (22-month-old mice) on visual function, retinal morphology and survival of injured retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in Rbfox1 knockout (KO) animals. A visual cliff test, which was used to evaluate visual function, showed that 22-month old Rbfox1 KO mice have profound depth perception deﬁciency. Retinal gross morphology in these animals appeared to be normal. Optic nerve crush (ONC) induced axonal injury resulted in approximately 50\% of RGC loss in both Rbfox1 KO and age-matched control animals: the average RGC densities in uninjured control and Rbfox1 KO animals were 6274 ± 1673 cells/mm2 and 6004 ± 1531 cells/mm2, respectively, whereas 1 week after ONC, RGC numbers in the retinas of control and Rbfox1 KO mice were reduced to 2998 ± 858 cells/mm2 and 3036 ± 857 cells/mm2, respectively (Rbfox1 KO vs. Rbfox1 KO + ONC, p {\textless} 0.0001 and control vs. control + ONC, p {\textless} 0.0001). No signiﬁcant difference between RGC numbers in Rbfox1 KO + ONC and age-matched control + ONC animals was observed, suggesting that Rbfox1 has no effect on the survival of injured RGCs. Interestingly, however, contrary to a commonly accepted view that the number of RGCs in old (18 month of age) compared to young animals is reduced by approximately 40\%, the RGC densities in 22-month-old mice in this study were similar to those of 4-month-old counterparts.},

Studies of Tibetans revealed candidates for high-altitude adaptations in the EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes, associated with lower hemoglobin concentration. However, the history of these variants or that of Tibetans remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze genotype data for the Nepalese Sherpa, and find that Tibetans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to the Sherpa and Han Chinese. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Accordingly, the Sherpa and Tibetans share adaptive hemoglobin traits. This admixture-mediated adaptation shares important features with adaptive introgression. Therefore, we identify a novel mechanism, beyond selection on new mutations or on standing variation, through which populations can adapt to local environments.},

The aim of this study was to integrate an increasing number of data on EPAS1 into a map of diverse OMICs elements. Publications, databases, and bioinformatics tools were examined, including Ensembl, MethPrimer, STRING, miRTarBase, COSMIC, and LOVD. The EPAS1 expression, stability, and activity are tightly regulated on several OMICs levels to maintain complex oxygen homeostasis. In the integrative EPAS1 map we included: 31 promoter-binding proteins, 13 interacting miRNAs and one lncRNA, and 16 post-translational modiﬁcations regulating EPAS1 protein abundance. EPAS1 has been associated with various cancer types and other diseases. The development of neuroendocrine tumors and erythrocytosis was shown to be associated with 11 somatic and 20 germline variants. The integrative map also includes 12 EPAS1 target genes and 27 interacting proteins. The study introduced the ﬁrst integrative map of diverse genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, regulomics, and interactomics data associated with EPAS1, to enable a better understanding of EPAS1 activity and regulation and support future research.},

To date, genetic analyses have identified several common variants that are associated with LP. Furthermore, data have indicated that these functional alleles likely have been maintained in pastoralist populations due to the action of recent selection, exemplifying the ongoing evolution of anatomically modern humans. Additionally, demographic history has also played a role in the geographic distribution of LP and associated alleles in Africa. In particular, the migration of ancestral herders and their subsequent admixture with local populations were integral to the spread of LP alleles and the culture of pastoralism across the continent. The timing of these demographic events was often correlated with known major environmental changes and/or the ability of domesticated cattle to resist/avoid infectious diseases. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the genetic basis and evolutionary history of LP, as well as the factors that inf luenced the origin and spread of pastoralism in Africa.},

	abstract = {Lactase persistence, the ability to digest the milk sugar lactose in adulthood, is highly associated with a T allele situated 13,910 bp upstream from the actual lactase gene in Europeans. The frequency of this allele rose rapidly in Europe after transition from hunteregatherer to agriculturalist lifestyles and the introduction of milkable domestic species from Anatolia some 8000 years ago. Here we ﬁrst introduce the archaeological and historic background of early farming life in Europe, then summarize what is known of the physiological and genetic mechanisms of lactase persistence. Finally, we compile the evidence for a co-evolutionary process between dairying culture and lactase persistence. We describe the different hypotheses on how this allele spread over Europe and the main evolutionary forces shaping this process. We also summarize three different computer simulation approaches, which offer a means of developing a coherent and integrated understanding of the process of spread of lactase persistence and dairying.},

	abstract = {By impairing both function and survival, the severe reduction in oxygen availability associated with high-altitude environments is likely to act as an agent of natural selection. We used genomic and candidate gene approaches to search for evidence of such genetic selection. First, a genome-wide allelic differentiation scan (GWADS) comparing indigenous highlanders of the Tibetan Plateau (3,200–3,500 m) with closely related lowland Han revealed a genome-wide significant divergence across eight SNPs located near
              EPAS1
              . This gene encodes the transcription factor HIF2α, which stimulates production of red blood cells and thus increases the concentration of hemoglobin in blood. Second, in a separate cohort of Tibetans residing at 4,200 m, we identified 31
              EPAS1
              SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium that correlated significantly with hemoglobin concentration. The sex-adjusted hemoglobin concentration was, on average, 0.8 g/dL lower in the major allele homozygotes compared with the heterozygotes. These findings were replicated in a third cohort of Tibetans residing at 4,300 m. The alleles associating with lower hemoglobin concentrations were correlated with the signal from the GWADS study and were observed at greatly elevated frequencies in the Tibetan cohorts compared with the Han. High hemoglobin concentrations are a cardinal feature of chronic mountain sickness offering one plausible mechanism for selection. Alternatively, as
              EPAS1
              is pleiotropic in its effects, selection may have operated on some other aspect of the phenotype. Whichever of these explanations is correct, the evidence for genetic selection at the
              EPAS1
              locus from the GWADS study is supported by the replicated studies associating function with the allelic variants.},

	abstract = {The hypoxic environment imposes severe selective pressure on species living at high altitude. To understand the genetic bases of adaptation to high altitude in dogs, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 60 dogs including five breeds living at continuous altitudes along the Tibetan Plateau from 800 to 5100 m as well as one European breed. More than 150× sequencing coverage for each breed provides us with a comprehensive assessment of the genetic polymorphisms of the dogs, including Tibetan Mastiffs. Comparison of the breeds from different altitudes reveals strong signals of population differentiation at the locus of hypoxia-related genes including endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (
              EPAS1
              ) and beta hemoglobin cluster. Notably, four novel nonsynonymous mutations specific to high-altitude dogs are identified at
              EPAS1
              , one of which occurred at a quite conserved site in the PAS domain. The association testing between
              EPAS1
              genotypes and blood-related phenotypes on additional high-altitude dogs reveals that the homozygous mutation is associated with decreased blood flow resistance, which may help to improve hemorheologic fitness. Interestingly,
              EPAS1
              was also identified as a selective target in Tibetan highlanders, though no amino acid changes were found. Thus, our results not only indicate parallel evolution of humans and dogs in adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, but also provide a new opportunity to study the role of
              EPAS1
              in the adaptive processes.},

I identify two main, yet mutually exclusive, strategies of employing the concept of a just-so story: a negative strategy and a positive strategy. Subsequently, I argue that these strategies do not satisfactorily capture the core of the “original” meaning advanced by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin at the end of the 1970s. I revisit the foundation(s) of their anti-adaptationist critique in order to reframe it as a critique of distinctive methodological manners and epistemic maxims related to historical inquiry. Last but not least, I suggest that contemporary evolutionary thinkers have two conceptually different options: they can either adhere to the “original” meaning of the term “just-so story” or accept that “just-so story” is a term equivalent to “implausible narrative explanation.”},

The thrifty gene hypothesis, formulated by the American geneticist and travelling scientist James V. Neel in 1962, proposed that Indigenous peoples were genetically predisposed to Type 2 diabetes due to the foodways of their ancestors. The hypothesis was func­tionally racist and based on what biologi­cal anthropologists now call ‘the myth of forager food insecurity.’ Importantly, Neel reconsidered his own hypothesis in 1982 before he ultimately rejected it in 1999; nonetheless, in the mid-1990s, a team of Canadian scientists led by the endocrinolo­gist Robert Hegele of Western University conducted a genetic study on the OjiCree community of Sandy Lake First Nation in northern Ontario. Thereafter, Hegele told the academic world and news media that he had discovered a thrifty gene in Sandy Lake. Like Neel, Hegele later came to reject his own study in 2011. Nonetheless, the ‘thrifty gene hypothesis’ and Hegele’s Sandy Lake study continue to be cited, referenced, and reproduced in the current Clinical Guidelines of the Canadian Diabetes Asso­ciation, as well as across state-related health literature more broadly. The purpose of this study, then, will be to apply the PHCRP to the thrifty gene hypothesis in a Canadian context.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p class="Pa7"{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}Ethn Dis.{\textless}/em{\textgreater}2018;28(Suppl 1):247- 252; doi:10.18865/ed.28.S1.247.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies in animal models evidenced that genetic mutations of KATNAL1, resulting in dysfunction of its encoded protein, lead to male infertility through disruption of microtubule remodelling and premature germ cell exfoliation. Subsequent studies in humans also suggested a possible role of KATNAL1 singlenucleotide polymorphisms in the development of male infertility as a consequence of severe spermatogenic failure.
Objectives: The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of the common genetic variation of KATNAL1 in a large and phenotypically well-characterised cohort of infertile men because of severe spermatogenic failure. Materials and methods: A total of 715 infertile men because of severe spermatogenic failure, including 210 severe oligospermia and 505 non-obstructive azoospermia patients, as well as 1058 unaffected controls were genotyped for three KATNAL1 single-nucleotide polymorphism taggers (rs2077011, rs7338931 and rs2149971). Case–control association analyses by logistic regression assuming different models and in silico functional characterisation of risk variants were conducted.
Results: Genetic associations were observed between the three analysed taggers and different severe spermatogenic failure groups. However, in all cases, the haplotype model (rs2077011*C {\textbar} rs7338931*T {\textbar} rs2149971*A) better explained the observed associations than the three risk alleles independently. This haplotype was associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (adjusted p = 4.96E-02, odds ratio = 2.97), Sertolicell only syndrome (adjusted p = 2.83E-02, odds ratio = 5.16) and testicular sperm extraction unsuccessful outcomes (adjusted p = 8.99E-04, odds ratio = 6.13). The in silico analyses indicated that the effect on severe spermatogenic failure predisposition could be because of an alteration of the KATNAL1 splicing pattern.
Conclusions: Specific allelic combinations of KATNAL1 genetic polymorphisms may confer a risk of developing severe male infertility phenotypes by favouring the overrepresentation of a short non-functional transcript isoform in the testis.},

Of particular interest are islands classiﬁed as Polynesian Outliers, where people speak Polynesian languages and have distinctly Polynesian cultural traits, but are located within the Melanesian or Micronesian cultural areas. While the classiﬁcation of these groups as Polynesian is not in dispute, the material evidence for the movement between Polynesia and the Polynesian Outliers is exceedingly rare, unconﬁrmed, and in most cases, nonexistent. We report on the ﬁrst comprehensive sourcing (using a portable X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrometer) of obsidian and volcanic glass artifacts recovered from excavations on the Polynesian Outlier island of Tikopia. We ﬁnd evidence for: (1) initial settlement followed by continued voyages between Tikopia and an island Melanesian homeland; (2) long-distance voyaging becoming much less frequent and continuing to decline; and (3) later voyaging from Polynesia marked by imports of volcanic glass from Tonga beginning at 765 cal yr BP (±54 yr). Later long-distance voyages from Polynesia were surprisingly rare, given the strong cultural and linguistic inﬂuences of Polynesia, and we suggest, may indicate that Tikopia was targeted by Tongans for political expansion.},

	abstract = {In 1983, Russell Lande and Stevan Arnold published “The measurement of selection on correlated characters,” which became a highly influential citation classic in evolutionary biology. This paper stimulated a cottage industry of field studies of natural and sexual selection in nature and resulted in several large-scale meta-analyses, statistical developments, and method papers. The statistical tools they suggested contributed to a breakdown of the traditional dichotomy between ecological and evolutionary time scales and stimulated later developments such as “eco-evolutionary dynamics”. However, regression-based selection analyses also became criticized from philosophical, methodological, and statistical viewpoints and stimulated some still ongoing debates about causality in evolutionary biology. Here I return to this landmark paper by Lande and Arnold, analyze the controversies and debates it gave rise to and discuss the past, present, and future of selection analyses in natural populations. A remaining legacy of Lande \& Arnold, 1983 is that studies of selection and inheritance can fruitfully be decoupled and be studied separately, since selection acts on phenotypes regardless of their genetic basis, and hence selection and evolutionary responses to selection are distinct processes.},

The Marquesas, located at the eastern-most fringes of the Austronesian expansion, offer a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a protracted population expansion wave on population structure. We explore the contribution of Melanesian, Asian and European heritage to the Marquesan islands of Nuku-Hiva, Hiva-Oa and Tahuata. Overall, the Marquesas Islands are genetically homogeneous. In the Marquesan Archipelago all of the mtDNA haplogroups are of Austronesian origin belonging to the B4a1 subhaplogroup as the region marks the end of a west to east decreasing cline of Melanesian mtDNA starting with the West Polynesian population of Tonga. Genetic discrepancies are less pronounced between the Marquesan and Society islands, and among the Marquesan islands. Interestingly, a number of Melanesian, Polynesian and European Y-chromosome haplogroups exhibit very different distribution between the Marquesan islands of Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa, likely resulting from drift, differential migration involving various source populations and/or unique trading routes.},

            Artificial intelligence is an advanced method to identify novel anticancer targets and discover novel drugs from biology networks because the networks can effectively preserve and quantify the interaction between components of cell systems underlying human diseases such as cancer. Here, we review and discuss how to employ artificial intelligence approaches to identify novel anticancer targets and discover drugs. First, we describe the scope of artificial intelligence biology analysis for novel anticancer target investigations. Second, we review and discuss the basic principles and theory of commonly used network-based and machine learning-based artificial intelligence algorithms. Finally, we showcase the applications of artificial intelligence approaches in cancer target identification and drug discovery. Taken together, the artificial intelligence models have provided us with a quantitative framework to study the relationship between network characteristics and cancer, thereby leading to the identification of potential anticancer targets and the discovery of novel drug candidates.},

            This article reports on an exploration of the Y-chromosome sub-haplogroup O2a2b-P164 in Austronesian-speaking populations. Moderate to high abundance of the P 164 mutation is seen in the West Pacific including the Amis of Formosa (36\%) and the Filipinos of Mindanao (50\%) as well as in the Kiritimati of Micronesia (70\%), and Tonga and Samoa of West Polynesia (54\% and 33\%, respectively), and it drops to low frequencies in populations of East Polynesia. The communities of Polynesia and Micronesia exhibit considerable inter- and intra-population haplotype sharing suggesting extensive population affinity. The observed affinities, as well as the ages and diversity values within the P 164 sub-haplogroup among Austronesian-speaking populations signal an ancestral migration route and relationships that link the Amis of Taiwan with distant communities in West and East Polynesia, Micronesia, and the Maori of New Zealand. High resolution sequencing of the Austronesian Y chromosome indicate that the P 164 lineage originated about 19,000 ya and then split into three branches separating the Ami aborigines, Southeast Asian and Polynesian/Micronesian populations about 4700 ya, roughly coinciding with the initiation of the Austronesian diaspora. The Y-chromosomes of all the Polynesian and Micronesian population examined belong to the new FT 257096 haplogroup.},

	abstract = {Single-cell molecular tools have been developed at an incredible pace over the last ﬁve years as sequencing costs continue to drop and numerous molecular assays have been coupled to sequencing readouts. This rapid period of technological development has facilitated the delineation of individual molecular characteristics including the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome of individual cells, leading to an unprecedented resolution of the molecular networks governing complex biological systems. The immense power of single-cell molecular screens has been particularly highlighted through work in systems where cellular heterogeneity is a key feature, such as stem cell biology, immunology, and tumor cell biology. Single-cell-omics technologies have already contributed to the identiﬁcation of novel disease biomarkers, cellular subsets, therapeutic targets and diagnostics, many of which would have been undetectable by bulk sequencing approaches. More recently, efforts to integrate single-cell multi-omics with single cell functional output and/or physical location have been challenging but have led to substantial advances. Perhaps most excitingly, there are emerging opportunities to reach beyond the description of static cellular states with recent advances in modulation of cells through CRISPR technology, in particular with the development of base editors which greatly raises the prospect of cell and gene therapies. In this review, we provide a brief overview of emerging single-cell technologies and discuss current developments in integrating single-cell molecular screens and performing single-cell multi-omics for clinical applications. We also discuss how single-cell molecular assays can be usefully combined with functional data to unpick the mechanism of cellular decision-making. Finally, we reﬂect upon the introduction of spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, its complementary role with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and potential application in cellular and gene therapy.},

Despite the vastness of the distances covered, research suggests that prehistoric Polynesian populations maintained spheres of continuing interaction for at least some period of time in some regions. A low level of genetic variation in ancestral Polynesian populations, genetic admixture (both prehistoric and post-European contact), and severe population crashes resulting from introduction of European diseases make it difficult to trace prehistoric human mobility in the region by using only human genetic and morphological markers. We focus instead on an animal that accompanied the ancestral Polynesians on their voyages. DNA phylogenies derived from mitochondrial control-region sequences of Pacific rats (Rattus exulans) from east Polynesia are presented. A range of specific hypotheses regarding the degree of interaction within Polynesia are tested. These include the issues of multiple contacts between central east Polynesia and the geographically distinct archipelagos of New Zealand and Hawaii. Results are inconsistent with models of Pacific settlement involving substantial isolation after colonization and confirm the value of genetic studies on commensal species for elucidating the history of human settlement.},

Seven major genotypes with additional subtypes serve as plausible markers for following early and more recent human migrations in all parts of the world. Phylogenetic trees of JCV sequences from the major continental population groups show a trifurcation at the base indicating early division into European, African, and Asian branches. Here, we have explored JCV relationships in the island populations of the western Paciﬁc. Since these islands were settled from the Asian mainland and islands of Southeast Asia, we expected that their virus genotypes might show an Asian connection. We found that Type 2E (Austronesian) and Type 8 (non-Austronesian) are widely distributed in western Paciﬁc populations. A few south China strains were found (Type 7A). A subtype of Type 8, Type 8A, was conﬁned to Papua New Guinea. In keeping with these assignments we ﬁnd that phylogenetic analysis by neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods places Type 2E in a closer relationship to east Asian mainland strains such as Type 2A and Type 7. Our ﬁndings support the Asian origins of the western Paciﬁc JCV strains, and suggest three broad movements: an ancient one characterized by Type 8A, and then Type 8B, followed much later by migrations carrying Type 2E, which may correlate with the arrival of Austronesian-language speakers, the bearers of the “Lapita” cultural complex (∼3,500 to 5,000 years ago), and relatively recent movements carrying largely Type 7A (south China) strains directly from the West.},

	abstract = {Twenty-five percent of the New Zealand population is either M aori or Pacific and are thus indigenous to the region. The New Zealand National Metabolic Service has considerable experience in diagnosing and managing metabolic diseases in this population. The frequencies and phenotypes of inborn errors of metabolism in indigenous people differ from that in Western European populations. Metabolic services need to be aware of these local variations and adapt their screening and treatment protocols accordingly. Likewise, the services themselves need to adopt culturally appropriate practices. This includes an understanding of the language, ideally employment of indigenous people and targeting of the service to meet the needs of the people. Knowledge of the metabolic diseases common within particular ethnic groups is important for the rapid delivery of appropriate management. Newborn screening protocols need to reflect the local populations. With the advent of expanded newborn screening relatively benign forms of fatty acid oxidation disorders have been commonly encountered. This high prevalence may reflect a selective evolutionary advantage as similar conditions have been found in other ethnic groups with traditionally high fat and low carbohydrate diets. HLA haplotypes of indigenous populations are less represented in international stem cell transplant databanks thereby making the option of human stem cell transplant more challenging. The recent discovery that short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase deficiency is particularly common in New Zealand with nearly a dozen cases identified this year suggests there is still a lot to learn regarding M aori and Pacific and indeed an indigenous metabolic disease.},

We report the ﬁrst whole genome mtDNA from domestic pigs from any of the remote islands of the Paciﬁc. In this brief report, we describe the close link we discovered between ancient mtDNA from archaeological specimens from across Polynesia and from that of modern pigs in northern peninsular Southeast Asia, speciﬁcally southern China’s Yunnan Province. More complete mtDNA coverage in commensal animals is necessary to improve our picture of the settlement of Polynesia (ca. 2800–700 years before the present) and specify the route, or routes, that pigs took from northern peninsular Southeast Asia.},

	abstract = {The recent global obesity epidemic is attributed to major societal and environmental changes, such as excessive energy intake and sedentary lifestyle. However, exposure to ‘obesogenic’ environments does not necessarily result in obesity at the individual level, as 40–75\% of body mass index variation in population is attributed to genetic differences. The thrifty genotype theory posits that genetic variants promoting efficient food sequestering and optimal deposition of fat during periods of food abundance were evolutionarily advantageous for the early hunter–gatherer and were positively selected. However, the thrifty genotype is likely too simplistic and fails to provide a justification for the complex distribution of obesity predisposing gene variants and for the broad range of body mass index observed in diverse ethnic groups. This review proposes that gene pleiotropy may better account for the variability in the distribution of obesity susceptibility alleles across modern populations. We outline the lazy-thrifty versus peppy-thrifty genotype hypothesis and detail the body of evidence in the literature in support of this novel concept. Future population genetics and mathematical modelling studies that account for pleiotropy may further improve our understanding of the evolutionary origins of the current obesity epidemic.},

	abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an organism into unitary ‘traits’ and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with
              Baupläne
              so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain
              why
              they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin’s own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

However, it remains unclear how pathogens have exerted selective pressures on human genome diversity across different epochs and affected present-day inﬂammatory disease risk. Here, we use an ancestry-aware approximate Bayesian computation framework to estimate the nature, strength, and time of onset of selection acting on 2,879 ancient and modern European genomes from the last 10,000 years. We found that the bulk of genetic adaptation occurred after the start of the Bronze Age, {\textless}4,500 years ago, and was enriched in genes relating to host-pathogen interactions. Furthermore, we detected directional selection acting on speciﬁc leukocytic lineages and experimentally demonstrated that the strongest negatively selected candidate variant in immunity genes, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) D283G, is hypomorphic. Finally, our analyses suggest that the risk of inﬂammatory disorders has increased in post-Neolithic Europeans, possibly because of antagonistic pleiotropy following genetic adaptation to pathogens.},

Until recently, the study of natural selection in humans has largely been restricted to comparing individual candidate genes to theoretical expectations. The advent of genome-wide sequence and polymorphism data brings fundamental new tools to the study of natural selection. It is now possible to identify new candidates for selection and to reevaluate previous claims by comparison with empirical distributions of DNA sequence variation across the human genome and among populations. The flood of data and analytical methods, however, raises many new challenges. Here, we review approaches to detect positive natural selection, describe results from recent analyses of genome-wide data, and discuss the prospects and challenges ahead as we expand our understanding of the role of natural selection in shaping the human genome.},

	abstract = {Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus, two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95\% confidence interval: 40–270 kya). This is earlier than other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate migration. We estimate the European (CEU) and East Asian (CHB) divergence time to be 23 kya (95\% c.i.: 17–43 kya), long after archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate divergence between East Asians (CHB) and Mexican-Americans (MXL) of 22 kya (95\% c.i.: 16.3–26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).},

Allele frequencies are acquired by reading in genotypic data from ﬁles formatted for either GENEPOP or TEMPOFS. For each interval between consecutive cohorts, Ne is estimated at each locus and over all loci. Furthermore, Ne estimates are output for three different genetic drift estimators (Fs, Fc and Fk). Conﬁdence intervals are derived from a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of independent alleles. GONe has been validated over a wide range of Ne values, and for scenarios where survival and birth rates differ between sexes, sex ratios are unequal and reproductive variances differ.

However, there remains a gap in our understanding of the genetic factors that affect the health of Native Hawaiians. To fill this gap, we studied the genetic risk factors at both the chromosomal and sub-chromosomal scales using genome-wide SNP array data on {\textasciitilde}4,000 Native Hawaiians from the Multiethnic Cohort. We estimated the genomic proportion of Native Hawaiian ancestry (“global ancestry,” which we presumed to be Polynesian in origin), as well as this ancestral component along each chromosome (“local ancestry”) and tested their respective association with binary and quantitative cardiometabolic traits. After attempting to adjust for non-genetic covariates evaluated through questionnaires, we found that per 10\% increase in global Polynesian genetic ancestry, there is a respective 8.6\%, and 11.0\% increase in the odds of being diabetic (
              P

This association was driven by an uniquely prevalent variant in Polynesian ancestry individuals. However, we could not replicate this finding in an independent Polynesian cohort from Samoa due to the small sample size of the replication cohort. In conclusion, we showed that Polynesian ancestry, which likely capture both genetic and lifestyle risk factors, is associated with an increased risk of obesity, Type-2 diabetes, and heart failure, and that larger cohorts of Polynesian ancestry individuals will be needed to replicate the putative association on chr6 with T2D.},

	abstract = {Simulation is a key tool in population genetics for both methods development and empirical research, but producing simulations that recapitulate the main features of genomic datasets remains a major obstacle. Today, more realistic simulations are possible thanks to large increases in the quantity and quality of available genetic data, and the sophistication of inference and simulation software. However, implementing these simulations still requires substantial time and specialized knowledge. These challenges are especially pronounced for simulating genomes for species that are not well-s­ tudied, since it is not always clear what information is required to produce simulations with a level of realism sufficient to confidently answer a given question. The community-d­ eveloped framework stdpopsim seeks to lower this barrier by facilitating the simulation of complex population genetic models using up-t­o-­date information. The initial version of stdpopsim focused on establishing this framework using six well-c­ haracterized model species (Adrion et al., 2020). Here, we report on major improvements made in the new release of stdpopsim (version 0.2), which includes a significant expansion of the species catalog and substantial additions to simulation capabilities. Features added to improve the realism of the simulated genomes include non-c­ rossover recombination and provision of species-s­ pecific genomic annotations. Through community-d­ riven efforts, we expanded the number of species in the catalog more than threefold and broadened coverage across the tree of life. During the process of expanding the catalog, we have identified common sticking points and developed the best practices for setting up genome-s­ cale simulations. We describe the input data required for generating a realistic simulation, suggest good practices for obtaining the relevant information from the literature, and discuss common pitfalls and major considerations. These improvements to stdpopsim aim to further promote the use of realistic whole-­genome population genetic simulations, especially in non-­model organisms, making them available, transparent, and accessible to everyone.},

	abstract = {Population branch statistics, which estimate the branch lengths of focal populations with respect to two outgroups, have been used as an alternative to FST-based genome-wide scans for identifying loci associated with local selective sweeps. In addition to the original population branch statistic (PBS), there are subsequently proposed branch rescalings: normalized population branch statistic (PBSn1), which adjusts focal branch length with respect to outgroup branch lengths at the same locus, and population branch excess (PBE), which also incorporates median branch lengths at other loci. PBSn1 and PBE have been proposed to be less sensitive to allele frequency divergence generated by background selection or geographically ubiquitous positive selection rather than local selective sweeps. However, the accuracy and statistical power of branch statistics have not been systematically assessed. To do so, we simulate genomes in representative large and small populations with varying proportions of sites evolving under genetic drift or background N selection (approximated using variable e), local selective sweeps, and geographically parallel selective sweeps. We then assess the probability that local selective sweep loci are correctly identified as outliers by FST and by each of the branch statistics. We find that branch statistics consistently outperform FST at identifying local sweeps. When background selection and/or parallel sweeps are introduced, PBSn1 and especially PBE correctly identify local sweeps among their top outliers at a higher frequency than PBS. These results validate the greater specificity of rescaled branch statistics such as PBE to detect population-specific positive selection, supporting their use in genomic studies focused on local adaptation.},

One of such approaches involves the concept of extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) and its associated statistics. These statistics typically require phased haplotypes, and some of them necessitate polarized variants. Here, we unify and extend previously proposed modifications to loosen these requirements. We compare the modified versions with the original ones by measuring the false discovery rate in simulated whole-genome scans and by quantifying the overlap of inferred candidate regions in empirical data. We find that phasing information is indispensable for accurate estimation of withinpopulation statistics (for all but very large samples) and of cross-population statistics for small samples. Ancestry information, in contrast, is of lesser importance for both types of statistic. Our publicly available R package rehh incorporates the modified statistics presented here.},

Here, we first provide a comprehensive review and comparison of current methods pertinent to dating admixture events. Second, we assess various admixture dating tools. We do so by performing various simulations. Third, we apply the top two assessed methods to real data of a uniquely admixed population from South Africa. Results reveal that current dating admixture models are not sufficiently equipped to estimate ancient admixtures events and to identify multi-faceted admixture events in complex multi-way admixed populations. We conclude with a discussion of research areas where further work on dating admixture-based methods is needed.},

              The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) programme seeks to elucidate the genetic architecture and biology of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders, with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the TOPMed goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes)
              1
              . In the first 53,831 TOPMed samples, we detected more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97\% have frequencies of less than 1\% and 46\% are singletons that are present in only one individual (53\% among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in TOPMed studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01\%.},

	title = {On the limits of fitting complex models of population history to f-­statistics},
	abstract = {Our understanding of population history in deep time has been assisted by fitting admixture graphs (AGs) to data: models that specify the ordering of population splits and mixtures, which along with the amount of genetic drift and the proportions of mixture, is the only information needed to predict the patterns of allele frequency correlation among populations. The space of possible AGs relating populations is vast, and thus most published studies have identified fitting AGs through a manual process driven by prior hypotheses, leaving the majority of alternative models unexplored. Here, we develop a method for systematically searching the space of all AGs that can incorporate non-­genetic information in the form of topology constraints. We implement this findGraphs tool within a software package, ADMIXTOOLS 2, which is a reimplementation of the ADMIXTOOLS software with new features and large performance gains. We apply this methodology to identify alternative models to AGs that played key roles in eight publications and find that in nearly all cases many alternative models fit nominally or significantly better than the published one. Our results suggest that strong claims about population history from AGs should only be made when all well-­fitting and temporally plausible models share common topological features. Our re-e­ valuation of published data also provides insight into the population histories of humans, dogs, and horses, identifying features that are stable across the models we explored, as well as scenarios of populations relationships that differ in important ways from models that have been highlighted in the literature.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to explore more on contributing factors and prevention of overweight and obesity among Paciﬁc islanders.
Methods: Using Cochrane library guideline, four electronic databases, PubMed, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL, were systematically searched from 2010 to 2020. Search strategy included key concepts, free text terms, and database-controlled vocabulary terms to identify articles on determinants and preventative strategies of overweight and obesity in the Paciﬁc countries. A data extraction sheet was developed to extract relevant information required for analysis and theme development for this study.
Results: A total of 22 articles were summarized and categorized. Determinants of overweight and obesity identiﬁed two themes: environmental related factors 13.6\% (3/22) and sociocultural related factors 27.3\% (6/22). The preventative strategies of overweight and obesity was categorized into behavioural change 22.7\% (5/22), school-related 18.2\% (4/22), and policies 50\% (11/22). The quality assessment of articles showed “Good” 68.2\% (15/22), and “Fair” 31.8\% (7/22).
Conclusion: This study highlighted two contributing, non-medication factors aﬀecting overweight and obesity are both environmental and socio-cultural issues. Overweight and obesity preventative strategies identiﬁed in the Paciﬁc context considered behavioural change, knowledge enhancement, and policy development. Further research should aim at exploring the current preventative strategies in-depth, to appreciate the most feasible and recommended preventative approach within the Paciﬁc society.},

	abstract = {Several inferential methods using genomic data have been proposed to quantify and date population size changes in the history of species. At the same time an increasing number of studies have shown that population structure can generate spurious signals of population size change. Recently, Mazet et al. (2016) introduced, for a sample size of two, a timedependent parameter, which they called the IICR (inverse instantaneous coalescence rate). The IICR is equivalent to a population size in panmictic models, but not necessarily in structured models. It is characterised by a temporal trajectory that suggests population size changes, as a function of the sampling scheme, even when the total population size was constant. Here, we extend the work of Mazet et al. (2016) by (i) showing how the IICR can be computed for any demographic model of interest, under the coalescent, (ii) applying this approach to models of population structure (1D and 2D stepping stone, split models, two- and three-island asymmetric gene ﬂow, continent-island models), (iii) stressing the importance of the sampling strategy in generating different histories, (iv) arguing that IICR plots can be seen as summaries of genomic information that can thus be used for model choice or model exclusion (v) applying this approach to the question of admixture between humans and Neanderthals. Altogether these results are potentially important given that the widely used PSMC (pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent) method of Li and Durbin (2011) estimates the IICR of the sample, not necessarily the history of the populations.},

	abstract = {The beneficial substitution of an allele shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Thus, in principle, adaptations can be mapped by looking for the signature of directional selection in polymorphism data. In practice, such efforts are hampered by the need for an accurate characterization of the demographic history of the species and of the effects of positive selection. In an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, researchers are increasingly taking a purely empirical approach, in which a large number of genomic regions are ordered by summaries of the polymorphism data, and loci with extreme values are considered to be likely targets of positive selection. We evaluated the reliability of the “empirical” approach, focusing on applications to human data and to maize. To do so, we considered a coalescent model of directional selection in a sensible demographic setting, allowing for selection on standing variation as well as on a new mutation. Our simulations suggest that while empirical approaches will identify several interesting candidates, they will also miss many—in some cases, most—loci of interest. The extent of the trade-off depends on the mode of positive selection and the demographic history of the population. Specifically, the false-discovery rate is higher when directional selection involves a recessive rather than a co-dominant allele, when it acts on a previously neutral rather than a new allele, and when the population has experienced a population bottleneck rather than maintained a constant size. One implication of these results is that, insofar as attributes of the beneficial mutation (e.g., the dominance coefficient) affect the power to detect targets of selection, genomic scans will yield an unrepresentative subset of loci that contribute to adaptations.},

We genotyped women from this population for 4,301,332 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and found a strong association between the AS3MT (arsenic [+3 oxidation state] methyltransferase) gene and mono- and dimethylated arsenic in urine, suggesting that AS3MT functions as the major gene for arsenic metabolism in humans. We found strong genetic differentiation around AS3MT in the Argentinean Andes population, compared with a highly related Peruvian population (FST = 0.014) from a region with much less environmental arsenic. Also, 13 of the 100 SNPs with the highest genome-wide Locus-Speciﬁc Branch Length occurred near AS3MT. In addition, our examination of extended haplotype homozygosity indicated a selective sweep of the Argentinean Andes population, in contrast to Peruvian and Colombian populations. Our data show that adaptation to tolerate the environmental stressor arsenic has likely driven an increase in the frequencies of protective variants of AS3MT, providing the ﬁrst evidence of human adaptation to a toxic chemical.},

	abstract = {Papua New Guinea (PNG) hosts distinct environments mainly represented by the ecoregions of the Highlands and Lowlands that display increased altitude and a predominance of pathogens, respectively. Since its initial peopling approximately 50,000 years ago, inhabitants of these ecoregions might have differentially adapted to the environmental pressures exerted by each of them. However, the genetic basis of adaptation in populations from these areas remains understudied. Here, we investi­ gated signals of positive selection in 62 highlanders and 43 lowlanders across 14 locations in the main island of PNG using whole-genome genotype data from the Oceanian Genome Variation Project (OGVP) and searched for signals of positive se­ lection through population differentiation and haplotype-based selection scans. Additionally, we performed archaic ancestry estimation to detect selection signals in highlanders within introgressed regions of the genome. Among highland populations we identified candidate genes representing known biomarkers for mountain sickness (SAA4, SAA1, PRDX1, LDHA) as well as candidate genes of the Notch signaling pathway (PSEN1, NUMB, RBPJ, MAML3), a novel proposed pathway for high altitude adaptation in multiple organisms. We also identified candidate genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and angio­ genesis, processes inducible by hypoxia, as well as in components of the eye lens and the immune response. In contrast, can­ didate genes in the lowlands are mainly related to the immune response (HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA2, TAAR6, TAAR9, TAAR8, RNASE4, RNASE6, ANG). Moreover, we find two candidate regions to be also enriched with archaic introgressed segments, suggesting that archaic admixture has played a role in the local adaptation of PNG populations.},

These variants are absent from European chromosomes. Among the functions ascribed to APOL1 is the ability to lyse and kill trypanosomes. Intriguingly, APOL1 derived from the risk alleles, but not the “wild-type” allele, killed

              African Americans have higher rates of kidney disease than European Americans. Here, we show that, in African Americans, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and hypertension-attributed end-stage kidney disease (H-ESKD) are associated with two independent sequence variants in the

              gene on chromosome 22 \{FSGS odds ratio = 10.5 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 6.0 to 18.4]; H-ESKD odds ratio = 7.3 (95\% CI 5.6 to 9.5)\}. The two
              APOL1
              variants are common in African chromosomes but absent from European chromosomes, and both reside within haplotypes that harbor signatures of positive selection. ApoL1 (apolipoprotein L-1) is a serum factor that lyses trypanosomes. In vitro assays revealed that only the kidney disease–associated ApoL1 variants lysed
              Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense

We infer genome-wide ancestry, scan for signals of positive selection, and perform targeted genetic association with measured height variation. We identify multiple regions throughout the genome that may have played a role in adaptive evolution, many of which contain loci with roles in growth hormone, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways, as well as immunity and neuroendocrine signaling involved in reproduction and metabolism. The most striking results are found on chromosome 3, which harbors a cluster of selection and association signals between approximately 45 and 60 Mb. This region also includes the positional candidate genes DOCK3, which is known to be associated with height variation in Europeans, and CISH, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling known to inhibit growth hormone-stimulated STAT5 signaling. Finally, pathway analysis for genes near the strongest signals of association with height indicates enrichment for loci involved in insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling.},

Because specific skin colour phenotypes can be created by different combinations of skin colour–associated genetic markers, loss of genetic variability due to genetic drift appears to have had negligible effects on the highly redundant genetic ‘palette’ for the skin colour. This does not appear to have been the case for hair and eye coloration, however, and these traits appear to have been more strongly influenced by genetic drift and, possibly, sexual selection.

	abstract = {High-altitude hypoxia (reduced inspired oxygen tension due to decreased barometric pressure) exerts severe physiological stress on the human body. Two high-altitude regions where humans have lived for millennia are the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau. Populations living in these regions exhibit unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations to life at high altitude. Although these responses have been well characterized physiologically, their underlying genetic basis remains unknown. We performed a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia. We looked across each chromosome to identify genomic regions with previously unknown function with respect to altitude phenotypes. In addition, groups of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing were examined to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. Applying four population genetic statistics commonly used for detecting signatures of natural selection, we identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in these two populations (Andeans and Tibetans) separately. The Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from one another, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. However, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Our results indicate that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. These data suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaption and provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies necessary to confirm the role of selectionnominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.},

            The indigenous people of Greenland, the Inuit, have lived for a long time in the extreme conditions of the Arctic, including low annual temperatures, and with a specialized diet rich in protein and fatty acids, particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A scan of Inuit genomes for signatures of adaptation revealed signals at several loci, with the strongest signal located in a cluster of fatty acid desaturases that determine PUFA levels. The selected alleles are associated with multiple metabolic and anthropometric phenotypes and have large effect sizes for weight and height, with the effect on height replicated in Europeans. By analyzing membrane lipids, we found that the selected alleles modulate fatty acid composition, which may affect the regulation of growth hormones. Thus, the Inuit have genetic and physiological adaptations to a diet rich in PUFAs.},

	abstract = {The history of sweet potato in the Pacific has long been an enigma. Archaeological, linguistic, and ethnobotanical data suggest that prehistoric human-mediated dispersal events contributed to the distribution in Oceania of this American domesticate. According to the “tripartite hypothesis,” sweet potato was introduced into Oceania from South America in pre-Columbian times and was then later newly introduced, and diffused widely across the Pacific, by Europeans via two historically documented routes from Mexico and the Caribbean. Although sweet potato is the most convincing example of putative pre-Columbian connections between human occupants of Polynesia and South America, the search for genetic evidence of pre-Columbian dispersal of sweet potato into Oceania has been inconclusive. Our study attempts to fill this gap. Using complementary sets of markers (chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites) and both modern and herbarium samples, we test the tripartite hypothesis. Our results provide strong support for prehistoric transfer(s) of sweet potato from South America (Peru-Ecuador region) into Polynesia. Our results also document a temporal shift in the pattern of distribution of genetic variation in sweet potato in Oceania. Later reintroductions, accompanied by recombination between distinct sweet potato gene pools, have reshuffled the crop’s initial genetic base, obscuring primary patterns of diffusion and, at the same time, giving rise to an impressive number of local variants. Moreover, our study shows that phenotypes, names, and neutral genes do not necessarily share completely parallel evolutionary histories. Multidisciplinary approaches, thus, appear necessary for accurate reconstruction of the intertwined histories of plants and humans.},

Selected components of this lore are interpreted through comparative exegesis for correlation with archaeological science results in testable models of change. In a transfer and adaptation model, crop stores if not seasonal production technologies also were introduced from a warmer, agricultural Aotearoa region into dune microclimates of 15th-century coastal Otago to mitigate megafaunal loss, and perhaps to support Polynesia’s southernmost residential chiefdom in its earliest phase. A crop loss model proposes that cooler seasonal temperatures of the post-1450 Little Ice Age and (or) political change constrained

Many of them were not reported in historical literature and are neither present in Taiwan. For instance, no historical literature mentioned leopards inhabited in Taiwan, and thus their existence remained unknown. This study describes three fossil leopard (Panthera pardus) teeth uncovered from Longshia-dong Cave. Two isolated lower premolars and one lower molar, respectively p3, p4 and m1, were discovered in a very small area (11 × 6 cm) and show a series of progressive increase in size. Thus, the three teeth should have been belonging to the same individual from the subfamily of Pantherinae. Traditional linear measurements and two-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis for the occlusal surface outlines were conducted on the fossil teeth and extant pantherines inhabited in Asia such as clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), leopards (Panthera pardus), and tigers (Panthera tigiris). Results show that the fossil teeth are similar both in size and morphology to the teeth of extant leopards, suggesting the assignment of the fossil teeth to leopards. This study, for the first time, reported the presence of leopards in the Late Pleistocene of Taiwan. In addition, the smaller size of the fossil teeth in comparison with Chinese fossil leopards is putatively attributed to insular dwarfism or individual size variability, yet more studies are required.},

We describe the coalescent for panmictic populations of fmed size, and its extensions to incorporate various assumptions about variation in population size and nonrandom mating caused by geographicalpopulation subdivision. The effects of such genealogical structure on patterns and correlations in geneticdata are discussed.An urn model is usefulfor simulating samples at loci with complex mutation mechanisms.

	abstract = {Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes, even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking, concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate
              λ
              , the rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
              E

              ))), where the recombination rate
              r
              is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of recombination relative to selection (
              r
              /
              s
              ), and more weakly, on the neighbourhood size,

              Population isolates such as those in Finland benefit genetic research because deleterious alleles are often concentrated on a small number of low-frequency variants (0.1\% ≤ minor allele frequency {\textless} 5\%). These variants survived the founding bottleneck rather than being distributed over a large number of ultrarare variants. Although this effect is well established in Mendelian genetics, its value in common disease genetics is less explored

              . FinnGen aims to study the genome and national health register data of 500,000 Finnish individuals. Given the relatively high median age of participants (63 years) and the substantial fraction of hospital-based recruitment, FinnGen is enriched for disease end points. Here we analyse data from 224,737 participants from FinnGen and study 15 diseases that have previously been investigated in large genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also include meta-analyses of biobank data from Estonia and the United Kingdom. We identified 30 new associations, primarily low-frequency variants, enriched in the Finnish population. A GWAS of 1,932 diseases also identified 2,733 genome-wide significant associations (893 phenome-wide significant (PWS),

Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of {\textless}5\% in non-Finnish European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, high impact variants.},

Moreover, the presence of several Polynesian-speaking communities in the outliers of Mele, Ifira and Emae proves that migrations from Polynesian islands occurred centuries before European contact. In this paper, we analyze the available linguistic data in order to identify loanwords between Polynesian and non-Polynesian languages. We examine multiple sources of information to document the semantic values of the discussed forms, including ethnographic and archaeological sources. This approach, inspired by the ‘triangulation method’ developed by P. Kirch and R. Green, provides evidence for specific patterns of interaction that created a unique cultural sphere in central Vanuatu. Furthermore, this paper provides insight onto the kinds of items that should be present in the archaeological signatures of Polynesian occupations in this region.},

	abstract = {The low portability of polygenic scores (PGSs) across global populations is a major concern that must be addressed before PGSs can be used for everyone in the clinic. Indeed, prediction accuracy has been shown to decay as a function of the genetic distance between the training and test cohorts. However, such cohorts differ not only in their genetic distance but also in their geographical distance and their data collection and assaying, conﬂating multiple factors. In this study, we examine the extent to which PGSs are transferable between ancestries by deriving polygenic scores for 245 curated traits from the UK Biobank data and applying them in nine ancestry groups from the same cohort. By restricting both training and testing to the UK Biobank data, we reduce the risk of environmental and genotyping confounding from using different cohorts. We deﬁne the nine ancestry groups at a sub-continental level, based on a simple, robust, and effective method that we introduce here. We then apply two different predictive methods to derive polygenic scores for all 245 phenotypes and show a systematic and dramatic reduction in portability of PGSs trained using Northwestern European individuals and applied to nine ancestry groups. These analyses demonstrate that prediction already drops off within European ancestries and reduces globally in proportion to genetic distance. Altogether, our study provides unique and robust insights into the PGS portability problem.},

	abstract = {Inferring the demographic history of populations provides fundamental insights into species dynamics and is essential for developing a null model to accurately study selective processes. However, background selection and selective sweeps can produce genomic signatures at linked sites that mimic or mask signals associated with historical popula­ tion size change. While the theoretical biases introduced by the linked effects of selection have been well established, it is unclear whether ancestral recombination graph (ARG)-based approaches to demographic inference in typical em­ pirical analyses are susceptible to misinference due to these effects. To address this, we developed highly realistic for­ ward simulations of human and Drosophila melanogaster populations, including empirically estimated variability of gene density, mutation rates, recombination rates, purifying, and positive selection, across different historical demographic scenarios, to broadly assess the impact of selection on demographic inference using a genealogy-based approach. Our results indicate that the linked effects of selection minimally impact demographic inference for human populations, although it could cause misinference in populations with similar genome architecture and population parameters experiencing more frequent recurrent sweeps. We found that accurate demographic inference of D. melanogaster populations by ARG-based methods is compromised by the presence of pervasive background selec­ tion alone, leading to spurious inferences of recent population expansion, which may be further worsened by recur­ rent sweeps, depending on the proportion and strength of beneficial mutations. Caution and additional testing with species-specific simulations are needed when inferring population history with non-human populations using ARG-based approaches to avoid misinference due to the linked effects of selection.},

              Rapa Nui (also known as Easter Island) is one of the most isolated inhabited places in the world. It has captured the imagination of many owing to its archaeological record, which includes iconic megalithic statues called moai
              1
              . Two prominent contentions have arisen from the extensive study of Rapa Nui. First, the history of the Rapanui has been presented as a warning tale of resource overexploitation that would have culminated in a major population collapse—the ‘ecocide’ theory
              2–4
              . Second, the possibility of trans-Pacific voyages to the Americas pre-dating European contact is still debated
              5–7
              . Here, to address these questions, we reconstructed the genomic history of the Rapanui on the basis of 15 ancient Rapanui individuals that we radiocarbon dated (1670–1950 
              ce
              ) and whole-genome sequenced (0.4–25.6×). We find that these individuals are Polynesian in origin and most closely related to present-day Rapanui, a finding that will contribute to repatriation efforts. Through effective population size reconstructions and extensive population genetics simulations, we reject a scenario involving a severe population bottleneck during the 1600s, as proposed by the ecocide theory. Furthermore, the ancient and present-day Rapanui carry similar proportions of Native American admixture (about 10\%). Using a Bayesian approach integrating genetic and radiocarbon dates, we estimate that this admixture event occurred about 1250–1430

	abstract = {The goal of evolutionary biology is to explain the diversity of the entire sweep of the natural world; population biology only examines tiny slices of time of a few individuals of single species. What gives the tiny scale of population biology its relevance to evolutionary biology is the following assumption: processes identical or similar to those observed in a given population biology study are operative in unexamined individuals in the same species, have been operative throughout the history of the species, and are operative in other species. Without this assumption, population biology studies are just very detailed descriptions of a handful of individuals of a species. Population biology lacks the means to test its jusifying assumption. It is tested by the comparative method, studies of convergent evolution across species. The comparative method has its own blind spots, mainly its inability to examine intraspecific variation, heritability, and fitness directly, exactly the purview of population biology. Population and comparative biology thus provide complementary sources of direct evidence regarding evolutionary process. Both, along with optimality models, evo-devo studies of the variants that can or can’t be produced in development, together with assumptions about unseeable ancestral populations, make up essential parts of a maximally well-supported evolutionary explanation. Recognizing this essential epistemic interdependence shows why it is necessary to select sources of evidence from across population, comparative, optimality, and developmental studies, leading to collaboration rather than criticism across these fields, and stronger explanations accounting for the evolution of diversity in organismal form and function.},

boundaries or provinces, known as Far Western, Western, and Eastern, and it has
been thought that differences between them are partly temporal (Far Western) and

Eastern). This paper assesses these constructions by comparing dentate decorated
Lapita pottery from assemblages in West New Britain, Papua New Guinea, with
assemblages further afield. It is argued here that differences between these style
provinces are primarily due to temporal factors and that the terms Far Western,
Western, and Eastern should be replaced by Early, Middle, and Late Lapita.},

These segments are likely to represent autozygosity, the result of the mating of related individuals. Conﬁdence that the complete segment is homozygous is gained only with markers of high density. The longest segment in the eight families spanned 77 cM and included 118 homozygous markers. All individuals in family 884 showed at least one segment of homozygosity: the father and mother were homozygous in 8 and 10 segments with an average length of 13 and 16 cM, respectively, and covering a total of 105 and 160 cM, respectively. The progeny in family 884 were homozygous over 5–16 segments with average length 11 cM. The progeny in family 102 were homozygous over 4–12 segments with average length 19 cM. Of the 100 individuals in the other six families, 1 had especially long homozygous segments, and 19 had short but signiﬁcant homozygous segments. Our results indicate that long homozygous segments are common in humans and that these segments could have a substantial impact on gene mapping and health.},

Prehistoric genomes now document population transformations on every inhabited continent—in particular the effect of agricultural expansions in Africa, Europe, and Oceania—and record a history of natural selection that shapes present-day phenotypic diversity. Despite these advances, much remains unknown, in particular about the genomic histories of Asia (the most populous continent) and Africa (the continent that contains the most genetic diversity). Ancient genomes from these and other regions, integrated with a growing understanding of the genomic basis of human phenotypic diversity, will be in focus during the next decade of research in the ﬁeld.},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by ﬁtting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efﬁciency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difﬁculty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efﬁciency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efﬁciency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

Terrestrial, or land-based, fauna were an essential part of the prehistoric diet because they provided both protein and fat, which were often difficult to obtain from marine resources alone. P. orientalis was an important prey species because New Ireland had a relatively low range of prey taxa. Prior to 20,000 B.P., the New Ireland fauna were relatively meager: the potential terrestrial prey taxa for prehistoric hunters included bats, rats, birds, and reptiles. The introduction of the cuscus dramatically increased the number of individual animals and therefore expanded the island-based protein resource available to prehistoric hunters. This paper investigates the nature of the late Pleistocene to Holocene capture of P. orientalis based on data from Buang Merabak, a central New Ireland cave site, and investigates whether prehistoric hunters captured P. orientalis of a particular age and how this changed over time.},

              The Holocene (beginning around 12,000 years ago) encompassed some of the most significant changes in human evolution, with far-reaching consequences for the dietary, physical and mental health of present-day populations. Using a dataset of more than 1,600 imputed ancient genomes
              1
              , we modelled the selection landscape during the transition from hunting and gathering, to farming and pastoralism across West Eurasia. We identify key selection signals related to metabolism, including that selection at the FADS cluster began earlier than previously reported and that selection near the
              LCT
              locus predates the emergence of the lactase persistence allele by thousands of years. We also find strong selection in the HLA region, possibly due to increased exposure to pathogens during the Bronze Age. Using ancient individuals to infer local ancestry tracts in over 400,000 samples from the UK Biobank, we identify widespread differences in the distribution of Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age ancestries across Eurasia. By calculating ancestry-specific polygenic risk scores, we show that height differences between Northern and Southern Europe are associated with differential Steppe ancestry, rather than selection, and that risk alleles for mood-related phenotypes are enriched for Neolithic farmer ancestry, whereas risk alleles for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease are enriched for Western hunter-gatherer ancestry. Our results indicate that ancient selection and migration were large contributors to the distribution of phenotypic diversity in present-day Europeans.},

	title = {Ghat: an {R} package for identifying adaptive polygenic traits},
	abstract = {Identifying selection on polygenic complex traits in crops and livestock is important for understanding evolution and helps prioritize im­ portant characteristics for breeding. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to polygenic trait variation often exhibit small or infini­ tesimal effects. This hinders the ability to detect QTL-controlling polygenic traits because enormously high statistical power is needed for their detection. Recently, we circumvented this challenge by introducing a method to identify selection on complex traits by evaluating the relationship between genome-wide changes in allele frequency and estimates of effect size. The approach involves calculating a composite statistic across all markers that capture this relationship, followed by implementing a linkage disequilibrium-aware permuta­ tion test to evaluate if the observed pattern differs from that expected due to drift during evolution and population stratification. In this manuscript, we describe “Ghat,” an R package developed to implement this method to test for selection on polygenic traits. We dem­ onstrate the package by applying it to test for polygenic selection on 15 published European wheat traits including yield, biomass, qual­ ity, morphological characteristics, and disease resistance traits. Moreover, we applied Ghat to different simulated populations with different breeding histories and genetic architectures. The results highlight the power of Ghat to identify selection on complex traits. The Ghat package is accessible on CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archival Network, and on GitHub.},

Complex traits and their evolution have been studied for more than a century, but only in the last decade have genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in humans begun to reveal their genetic basis. Here, we bring these threads of research together to ask how findings from GWASs can further our understanding of the processes that give rise to heritable variation in complex traits and of the genetic basis of complex trait evolution in response to changing selection pressures (i.e., of polygenic adaptation). Conversely, we ask how evolutionary thinking helps us to interpret findings from GWASs and informs related efforts of practical importance.},

Building on recent theoretical and empirical work we introduce the concept of adaptive architecture, which extends the genetic architecture of an adaptive trait by factors influencing its adaptive potential and population genetic principles. Because adaptation can be typically achieved by many different combinations of adaptive alleles (redundancy), we describe how two characteristics — heterogeneity among loci and non-parallelism between replicated populations — are hallmarks for the characterization of polygenic adaptation in evolving populations. We discuss how this unified framework can be applied to natural and experimental populations.},

Coupling the rich information in the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) with a powerful and scalable deep-learning framework, we developed a novel method to detect and quantify positive selection: Selection Inference using the Ancestral recombination graph (SIA). Built on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, a particular type of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), SIA can be trained to explicitly infer a full range of selection coefﬁcients, as well as the allele frequency trajectory and time of selection onset. We benchmarked SIA extensively on simulations under a European human demographic model, and found that it performs as well or better as some of the best available methods, including state-of-the-art machine-learning and ARG-based methods. In addition, we used SIA to estimate selection coefﬁcients at several loci associated with human phenotypes of interest. SIA detected novel signals of selection particular to the European (CEU) population at the MC1R and ABCC11 loci. In addition, it recapitulated signals of selection at the LCT locus and several pigmentation-related genes. Finally, we reanalyzed polymorphism data of a collection of recently radiated southern capuchino seedeater taxa in the genus Sporophila to quantify the strength of selection and improved the power of our previous methods to detect partial soft sweeps. Overall, SIA uses deep learning to leverage the ARG and thereby provides new insight into how selective sweeps shape genomic diversity.},

	title = {Deep estimation of the intensity and timing of natural selection from ancient genomes},
	abstract = {Leveraging past allele frequencies has proven to be key for identifying the impact of natural selection across time. However, this approach suffers from imprecise estimations of the intensity (s) and timing (T) of selection, particularly when ancient samples are scarce in specific epochs. Here, we aimed to bypass the computation of allele frequencies across arbitrarily defined past epochs and refine the estimations of selection parameters by implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) algorithms that directly use ancient genotypes sampled across time. Using computer simulations, we first show that genotype-b­ ased CNNs consistently outperform an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach based on past allele frequency trajectories, regardless of the selection model assumed and the number of available ancient genotypes. When applying this method to empirical data from modern and ancient Europeans, we replicated the reported increased number of selection events in post-­Neolithic Europe, independently of the continental subregion studied. Furthermore, we substantially refined the ABC-b­ ased estimations of s and T for a set of positively and negatively selected variants, including iconic cases of positive selection and experimentally validated disease-­risk variants. Our CNN predictions support a history of recent positive and negative selection targeting variants associated with host defence against pathogens, aligning with previous work that highlights the significant impact of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, in Europe. These findings collectively demonstrate that detecting the footprints of natural selection on ancient genomes is crucial for unravelling the history of severe human diseases.},

	abstract = {During their dispersals over the last 100,000 years, modern humans have been exposed to a large variety of environments, resulting in genetic adaptation. While genome-wide scans for the footprints of positive Darwinian selection have increased knowledge of genes and functions potentially involved in human local adaptation, they have globally produced evidence of a limited contribution of selective sweeps in humans. Conversely, studies based on machine learning algorithms suggest that recent sweeps from standing variation are widespread in humans, an observation that has been recently questioned. Here, we sought to formally quantify the number of recent selective sweeps in humans, by leveraging approximate Bayesian computation and whole-genome sequence data. Our computer simulations revealed suitable ABC estimations, regardless of the frequency of the selected alleles at the onset of selection and the completion of sweeps. Under a model of recent selection from standing variation, we inferred that an average of 68 (from 56 to 79) and 140 (from 94 to 198) sweeps occurred over the last 100,000 years of human history, in African and Eurasian populations, respectively. The former estimation is compatible with human adaptation rates estimated since divergence with chimps, and reveals numbers of sweeps per generation per site in the range of values estimated in Drosophila. Our results conﬁrm the rarity of selective sweeps in humans and show a low contribution of sweeps from standing variation to recent human adaptation.},

However, we suggest that the role of development in explanations for adaptive evolution remains underappreciated in this body of work. By combining concepts of evolvability from evolutionary developmental biology and quantitative genetics, we outline a framework that is more appropriate to identify developmental causes of adaptive evolution. This framework demonstrates how experimental and comparative developmental biology and physiology can be leveraged to put the role of plasticity in evolution to the test.},

	abstract = {From an abstract, informational perspective, protein domains appear analogous to words in natural languages in which the rules of word association are dictated by linguistic rules, or grammar. Such rules exist for protein domains as well, because only a small fraction of all possible domain combinations is viable in evolution. We employ a popular linguistic technique,
              n
              -gram analysis, to probe the “proteome grammar”—that is, the rules of association of domains that generate various domain architectures of proteins. Comparison of the complexity measures of “protein languages” in major branches of life shows that the relative entropy difference (information gain) between the observed domain architectures and random domain combinations is highly conserved in evolution and is close to being a universal constant, at ∼1.2 bits. Substantial deviations from this constant are observed in only two major groups of organisms: a subset of Archaea that appears to be cells simplified to the limit, and animals that display extreme complexity. We also identify the
              n-
              grams that represent signatures of the major branches of cellular life. The results of this analysis bolster the analogy between genomes and natural language and show that a “quasi-universal grammar” underlies the evolution of domain architectures in all divisions of cellular life. The nearly universal value of information gain by the domain architectures could reflect the minimum complexity of signal processing that is required to maintain a functioning cell.},

The Ra’ivavae population is undergoing language shift to Tahitian and there exists some degree of multilingualism on the island with French as well.

On the one hand they are problematised from a post-colonial and human rights point of view as the material remains of historic and ongoing structural violence connected to scientific knowledge production. On the other, new methods in archaeological science have led to increasing demand for destructive sampling. Without guidance and support by laws and formal standardised profes­ sional guidelines, museums may find themselves squeezed from two opposing sides. Based on an analysis of laws and professional guidelines, and a large-scale survey of the practical handling of old human remains in Swedish museums, this article argues that the lack of a shared professional process that recognises the complexity of old human remains as both objects of science and lived lives, risks undermining the role of museums in their relationship to both the public and the research community.},

              Molecular anthropology has been widely used to infer the origin and processes of the colonization of Polynesia. However, there are still a lack of representative geographical studies of Eastern Polynesia and unchallenged genetic data about ancient Polynesian people. The absence of both of these elements prevents an accurate description of the demographic processes of internal dispersion within the Polynesian triangle. This study provides a twofold analysis of ancient and modern mtDNA in the eastern part of French Polynesia: the Gambier Islands. The paleogenetic analyses conducted on burials of the Temoe Atoll (14

              −17

              centuries) represent the first fully authenticated ancient human sequences from Polynesia. The identification of the “Melanesian” Q1 mtDNA lineage in ancient human remains substantiates the Near Oceanic contribution to the early gene pool of this region. Modern samples originate from Mangareva Island. Genealogical investigations enable us to reliably identify the conservation of the Melanesian component in Easternmost Polynesia, despite recent European colonization. Finally, the identification of rare mutations in sequences belonging to haplogroup B4a1a1a provides new perspectives to the debate on the internal peopling of the Polynesian region. Altogether, the results laid out in our study put the emphasis on the necessity of controlled sampling when discussing the internal settlement of Polynesia.
